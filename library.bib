@article{Sipe1987,
abstract = {We present a macroscopic theory for anisotropic second- and third-harmonic generation obtained in reflection from the surface and bulk of cubic centrosymmetric single crystals. The theory is based on possible electric dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic dipole sources. Completely general expressions for the harmonic fields are obtained for (100), (111), and (110) faces independent of the details of the surface response but consistent with crystal symmetry. The results obtained agree with all existing experimental data obtained by various groups during the past few years. The possibility of separating out surface and bulk responses is considered using symmetry, polarization, or geometry arguments and it is concluded that for second-harmonic generation this cannot be done in general without additional information. Third-harmonic generation, barring any strong resonantly enhanced surface electric dipole effects, is essentially a bulk probe.},

abstract = {Recently, the concepts of transverse spin angular momentum and Belinfante spin momentum of evanescent waves have drawn considerable attention. Here, we investigate these novel physical properties of electromagnetic fields in the context of chiral surface plasmon polaritons. We demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that chiral surface plasmon polaritons possess transverse spin angular momentum and Belinfante momentum with rich and nontrivial characteristics. We also show that the transverse spin angular momentum of chiral surface plasmon polaritons leads to the emergence of transverse optical forces in opposite directions for chiral objects of different handedness. The magnitude of this chiral transverse optical force on a chiral particle is comparable to the magnitude of the achiral optical forces on the particle, namely, the gradient force that arises from the intensity gradient and the scattering force that is the result of the linear momentum transfer of the photon to the particle.

abstract = {In 1950, a quarter of a century after his first-ever nonlinear optical experiment when intensity-dependent absorption was observed in uranium-doped glass, Sergey Vavilov predicted that birefringence, dichroism and polarization rotatory power should be dependent on light intensity. It required the invention of the laser to observe the barely detectable effect of light intensity on the polarization rotatory power of the optically active lithium iodate crystal, the phenomenon now known as the nonlinear optical activity, a high-intensity counterpart of the fundamental optical effect of polarization rotation in chiral media. Here we report that a plasmonic metamaterial exhibits nonlinear optical activity 30 million times stronger than lithium iodate crystals, thus transforming this fundamental phenomenon of polarization nonlinear optics from an esoteric phenomenon into a major effect of nonlinear plasmonics with potential for practical applications.},

abstract = {Artificially structured metamaterials have enabled unprecedented flexibility in manipulating electromagnetic waves and producing new functionalities, including the cloak of invisibility based on coordinate transformation1–3. Unlike other cloaking approaches4–6, which are typically limited to subwavelength objects, the transformation method allows the design of cloaking devices that render a macroscopic object invisible. In addition, the design is not sensitive to the object that is being cloaked. The first experimental demonstration of such a cloak at microwave frequencies was recently reported7. We note, however, that that design7 cannot be implemented for an optical cloak, which is certainly of particular interest because optical frequencies are where the word ‘invisibility' is conventionally defined. Here we present the design of a non-magnetic cloak operating at optical frequencies. The principle and structure of the proposed cylindrical cloak are analysed, and the general recipe for the implementation of such a device is provided.},

abstract = {The propagation of electromagnetic plane waves in an isotropic chiral medium is characterized, and a special interest is shown in chiral nihility and the effects of chirality on energy transmission. In particular, the wave impedance is matched to that of free space. Moreover, the refractive index n is also matched in impedance to that of free space when an appropriate value of the chirality is chosen. A "chiral nihility" medium is explored in which both the permittivity and the permeability tend to zero. Some specific case studies of chiral nihility are presented, and Brewster angles are found to cover an extremely wide range. The E-field distributions in these different cases where the chiral slab is placed in free space are analyzed by using the appropriate constitutive relations. It is shown from numerical calculations that one can obtain some critical characteristics of the effects of chirality on energy transmission and reflection, such as transparency and power tunneling.},

@article{Coles2012a,
abstract = {This paper develops, in precise quantum electrodynamic terms, photonic attributes of the “optical chirality density,” one of several measures long known to be conserved quantities for a vacuum electromagnetic field. The analysis lends insights into some recent interpretations of chiroptical experiments, in which this measure, and an associated chirality flux, have been treated as representing physically distinctive “superchiral” phenomena. In the fully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status, whose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals relationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing multimode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian modes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical chirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due cognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin-angular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is shown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic radiation have a common basis in differences between the populations of optical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a calculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent states to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms contribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the difference in left- and right-handed photon populations; the only other contribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance dependence corresponding to the claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon number-phase uncertainty relation. From the full analysis, it appears that the term “superchiral” can be considered redundant.},

abstract = {Chirality in nanoscience may offer new opportunities for applications beyond the traditional fields of chirality, such as the asymmetric catalysts in the molecular world and the chiral propellers in the macroscopic world. In the last two decades, there has been an amazing array of chiral nanostructures reported in the literature. This review aims to explore and categorize the common mechanisms underlying these systems. We start by analyzing the origin of chirality in simple systems such as the helical spring and hair vortex. Then, the chiral nanostructures in the literature were categorized according to their material composition and underlying mechanism. Special attention is paid to highlight systems with original discoveries, exceptional structural characteristics, or unique mechanisms.[on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {The heralded generation of entangled states is a long-standing goal in quantum information processing, because it is indispensable for a number of quantum protocols. Polarization entangled photon pairs are usually generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the emission is probabilistic. Their applications are generally accompanied by post-selection and destructive photon detection. Here, we report a source of entanglement generated in an event-ready manner by conditioned detection of auxiliary photons. This scheme benefits from the stable and robust properties of spontaneous parametric down-conversion and requires only modest experimental efforts. It is flexible and allows the preparation efficiency to be significantly improved by using beamsplitters with different transmission ratios. We have achieved a fidelity better than 87{\%} and a state preparation efficiency of 45{\%} for the source. This could offer promise in essential photonics-based quantum information tasks, and particularly in enabling optical quantum computing by reducing dramatically the computational overhead.},

abstract = {The toroidal dipole is a localized electromagnetic excitation, distinct from the magnetic and electric dipoles. While the electric dipole can be understood as a pair of opposite charges and the magnetic dipole as a current loop, the toroidal dipole corresponds to currents flowing on the surface of a torus. Toroidal dipoles provide physically significant contributions to the basic characteristics of matter including absorption, dispersion and optical activity. Toroidal excitations also exist in free space as spatially and temporally localized electromagnetic pulses propagating at the speed of light and interacting with matter. We review recent experimental observations of resonant toroidal dipole excitations in metamaterials and the discovery of anapoles, non-radiating charge-current configurations involving toroidal dipoles. While certain fundamental and practical aspects of toroidal electrodynamics remain open for the moment, we envision that exploitation of toroidal excitations can have important implications for the fields of photonics, sensing, energy and information.},

Such optical activity can occur in the electric-dipole approximation. However, to explain our results for chiral polymer films, magnetic contributions to the nonlinearity must be included. A technique that uses a quarter wave plate to continuously vary the polarization of the fundamental beam was used to determine the relative complex values of the components of the tensors that characterize the nonlinear interaction. The largest magnetic components were not, vert, similar 20{\%} of the largest electric components. Second-harmonic generation from achiral anisotropic surfaces can also lead to optical activity. This occurs if the orientation of the anisotropic sample makes an otherwise achiral experimental arrangement chiral. The effect occurs in the electric-dipole approximation and changes sign as the handedness of the setup is reversed.},

Naturally occurring molecules and biomolecules have typically CD signals in the UV range, whereas plasmonic nanocrystals exhibit strong plasmon resonances in the visible spectral interval. Therefore, excitations of chiral molecules and plasmon resonances are typically off-resonant. Nevertheless, we demonstrate theoretically that it is possible to create strongly-enhanced molecular CD utilizing the plasmons. This task is doubly challenging since it requires both creation and enhancement of the molecular CD in the visible region. We demonstrate this effect within the model which incorporates a chiral molecule and a plasmonic dimer. The associated mechanism of plasmonic CD comes from the Coulomb interaction which is greatly amplified in a plasmonic hot spot.},

While lattices decorated with nanoscale gammadia etched in thin metallic films have been described as two dimensional, planar nanostructures, they are better described as quasi-planar structures with some three dimensional character. We find that the optical activity of these structures arises not only from the dissymmetric backing by a substrate but, more importantly, from the selective rounding of the nanostructure edges. A true chiroptical response in the far-field is only allowed when the gammadia contain these non-planar features. This is demonstrated by polarimetric measurements in conjunction with electrodynamical simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation that consider non-ideal gammadia. It is also shown that subtle planar dissymmetries in gammadia are sufficient to generate asymmetric transmission of circular polarized light.},

abstract = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) has been used for the label-free detection of melittin upon intercalation into planar-supported lipid bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphotidylcholine (POPC). A novel counter-propagating SHG optical geometry was used to effectively isolate the achiral and chiral contributions of the surface, thus allowing for an investigation of both binding and structural contributions to melittin adsorption. Melittin binding to the membrane was monitored as a function of bulk concentration through detection of both the chiral and achiral SHG signal. Analysis of the SHG adsorption isotherms revealed Langmuir adsorption behavior for the achiral SH emission and Frumkin adsorption behavior for the chiral SH emission. The binding constants (Ka) obtained for the chiral and achiral SHG responses were determined to be 8.3??1.0??105 and 1.68??0.40??107M-1 respectively. The frequency dependent SHG response was also obtained for the achiral and chiral contributions. The SHG spectra show good correlation with the spectral transitions observed in both the UV-VIS and CD spectra of melittin in solution. The results of these studies have far reaching implications in the use of SHG for the analysis of protein interfacial phenomena. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Extrinsic or pseudo-chiral (meta)surfaces have an achiral structure, yet they can give rise to circular dichroism when the experiment itself becomes chiral. Although these surfaces are known to yield differences in reflected and transmitted circularly polarized light, the exact mechanism of the interaction has never been directly demonstrated. Here we present a comprehensive linear and nonlinear optical investigation of a metasurface composed of tilted gold nanowires. In the linear regime, we directly demonstrate the selective absorption of circularly polarised light depending on the orientation of the metasurface. In the nonlinear regime, we demonstrate for the first time how second harmonic generation circular dichroism in such extrinsic/pseudo-chiral materials can be understood in terms of effective nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements that switch sign depending on the orientation of the metasurface. By providing fundamental understanding of the chiroptical interactions in achiral metasurfaces, our work opens up new perspectives for the optimisation of their properties. Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is a very sensitive technique to characterize the symmetry and mor-phology of nanopatterned surfaces 1 . It is a background free detection technique that detects magnetic dipole or quadrupole contributions and more importantly a large signal can be produced in macroscopic media lacking inversion symmetry. The interface between two different media is a naturally occurring break in the symmetry as are the asymmetric nanopatterned shapes on metasurfaces. Using laser light to measure a metasurface's SHG response can easily reveal both of these breaks in symmetry. Another form of symmetry breaking is chirality, the lack of mirror symmetry, which can be uncovered by carefully designed SHG experiments 2,3},

abstract = {The plant derived flavonoid compound quercetin, possesses wide range of biological activities in the human body by interacting with nucleic acids, enzymes and other proteins. As has recently been shown this molecule of polyphenolic type extensively binds to human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant carrier protein in the blood. Electronic absorption, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and molecular modelling methods were used to characterize optical properties of the quercetin-HSA complex, and to gain information on the binding mechanism at molecular level. The red shift and hypochromism of the longest-wavelength absorption band of quercetin relative to the spectral properties in ethanol suggests that one or more phenolic OH groups of the bound ligand is ionized and that the exocyclic phenyl ring is not coplanar with the benzopyrone moiety. It was found that quercetin shows extrinsic optical activity on interaction with HSA. The induced CD spectra were utilized to calculate the association constant at 37 degrees (1.46+/-0.21 x 10(4)M(-1)) and to probe the ligand binding site. Results of the CD displacement experiments performed with palmitic acid and salicylate were interpreted together with the findings of molecular modelling calculation performed on the quercetin-HSA complex. Computational mapping of possible binding sites of quercetin revealed the molecule to be bound in the large hydrophobic cavity of subdomain IIA. The protein microenvironment of this site was found to be rich in polar (basic) amino acid residues which are able to help to stabilize the negatively charged ligand bound in non-planar conformation. Additionally, the position of quercetin within the binding pocket allows simultaneous binding of other ligands such as warfarin, or sodium salycilate.},

The gratings, which do not diffract, are shown to exhibit giant specific rotation (approximately 10(4) degrees/mm) of polarization in direct transmission at normal incidence. The rotation is the same for light incident on the front and back sides of the sample. Such reciprocity indicates three dimensionality of the structure arising from the asymmetry of light-plasmon coupling at the air-metal and substrate-metal interfaces. The structures thus enable polarization control with quasi-two-dimensional planar objects. However, in contradiction with recently suggested interpretation of experiments on larger scale but otherwise similar structures, the observed polarization phenomena violate neither reciprocity nor time-reversal symmetry.},

Chiral materials occur in two enantiomers, which are mirror images of each other. In recent years, chiral metamaterials based on metal nanostructures have been shown to lead to greatly enhanced OA effects in the linear optical response [2,3]. On the other hand, second-harmonic generation (SHG) from ideally achiral metal nanostructures is extremely sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking due to surface defects [4]. It is therefore important to study whether nonlinear techniques can be used as a probe of the handedness of chiral metamaterials fabricated using state-of-the art techniques. Here we demonstrate that SHG microscopy with circularly-polarized light possesses an unambiguous sensitivity to the handedness of twisted-cross metamaterials to the level of individual subwavelength-sized nano-objects.},

Magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) is the major nonlinear magneto-optical process involved. The new effects include enhanced MSHG, controlled and enhanced magnetic contrast, etc. Nanostructures such as thin films, nanoparticles, nanogratings, and nanoarrays are critical for the excitation of SPs, which makes NMP an interdisciplinary research field in nanoscience and nanotechnology. In this review article, we organize recent work in this field into two categories: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) representing propagating surface plasmons, and localized surface plasmons (LSPs), also called particle plasmons. We review the structures, experiments, findings, and the applications of NMP from various groups.},

@article{Bradshaw2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. When circularly polarized light interacts with chiral molecules or nanoscale particles powerful symmetry principles determine the possibility of achieving chiral discrimination, and the detailed form of electrodynamic mechanisms dictate the types of interaction that can be involved. The optical trapping of molecules and nanoscale particles can be described in terms of a forward-Rayleigh scattering mechanism, with trapping forces being dependent on the positioning within the commonly non-uniform intensity beam profile. In such a scheme, nanoparticles are commonly attracted to local potential energy minima, ordinarily towards the centre of the beam. For achiral particles the pertinent material response property usually entails an electronic polarizability involving transition electric dipole moments. However, in the case of chiral molecules, additional effects arise through the engagement of magnetic counterpart transition dipoles. It emerges that, when circularly polarized light is used for the trapping, a discriminatory response can be identified between left- and right-handed polarizations. Developing a quantum framework to accurately describe this phenomenon, with a tensor formulation to correctly represent the relevant molecular properties, the theory leads to exact analytical expressions for the associated energy landscape contributions. Specific results are identified for liquids and solutions, both for isotropic media and also where partial alignment arises due to a static electric field. The paper concludes with a pragmatic analysis of the scope for achieving enantiomer separation by such methods.},

abstract = {Recently, a great amount of research has been triggered by the prediction, formulated by Pendry and co-authors, that novel and enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena could be observed in metamaterials.[1] This prediction is based on the fact that, in metamaterials, local field enhancements can have a dramatic influence over the optical properties of the material. One of the largest contributions to such local field enhancements is attributable to surface plasmon resonances. Plasmons are collective oscillations of the electrons under the influence of light's electromagnetic field. Plasmons occur naturally on the surfaces of homogeneous metal films, where they usually dissipate quickly and cancel each other's influence. However, upon patterning the metal surface at the nanoscale, plasmons can be manipulated in a manner similar to classical waveguiding, whereby propagation or standing wave patterns can be achieved. In other words, artificial structuring allows for nanoengineering the position and intensity of the local fields. Incidentally, nonlinear optical effects, such as second-, third-, or forth-harmonic generation, scale as the second, third or fourth power of the electromagnetic intensity, respectively. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the large electromagnetic local field enhancements in metamaterials should yield large or previously unobserved nonlinear optical effects.},

abstract = {Chiral nanostructures exhibit strong coupling to the spin angular momentum of incident photons. The integration of metal nanostructures with semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) to form hybrid plasmon-exciton nanoscale assemblies can potentially lead to plasmon-induced optical activity and unusual chiroptical properties of plasmon-exciton states. Here we investigate such effects in supraparticles (SPs) spontaneously formed from gold nanorods (NRs) and chiral CdTe NPs. The geometry of this new type of self-limited nanoscale superstructures depends on the molar ratio between NRs and NPs. NR dimers surrounded by CdTe NPs were obtained for the ratio NR/NP = 1:15, whereas increasing the NP content to a ratio of NR/NP = 1:180 leads to single NRs in a shell of NPs. The SPs based on NR dimers exhibit strong optical rotatory activity associated in large part with their twisted scissor-like geometry. The preference for a specific nanoscale enantiomer is attributed to the chiral interactions between CdTe NP in the shell. The SPs based on single NRs also yield surprising chiroptical activity at the frequency of the longitudinal mode of NRs. Numerical simulations reveal that the origin of this chiroptical band is the cross talk between the longitudinal and the transverse plasmon modes, which makes both of them coupled with the NP excitonic state. The chiral SP NR-NP assemblies combine the optical properties of excitons and plasmons that are essential for chiral sensing, chiroptical memory, and chiral catalysis.},

Numerical examples are given for split ring resonators and a chiral medium consisting of an array of helices to illustrate the usefulness of the formula and to verify the consistency constraint and reciprocity relations for a bianisotropic medium.},

abstract = {A strong chiral optical response induced at a plasmonic Fano resonance in a planar Au heptamer nanostructure was experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. The scattering spectra show the characteristic narrow-band feature of Fano resonances for both left and right circular polarized lights, with a chiral response reaching 30{\%} at the Fano resonance. Specifically, we systematically investigate the chiral response of planar heptamers with gradually changing the inter-particle rotation angles and separation distance. The chiral spectral characteristics clearly depend on the strength of Fano resonances and the associated near-field optical distributions. Finite element method simulations together with a multipole expansion method demonstrate that the enhanced chirality is caused by the excitation of magnetic quadrupolar and electric toroidal dipolar modes. Our work provides an effective method for the design of 2D nanostructures with a strong chiral response.},

abstract = {Chiral molecules play an important role in biological and chemical processes, but physical effects due to their symmetry-breaking are generally weak. Several physical chiral separation schemes which could potentially be useful, including the propeller effect, have therefore not yet been demonstrated at the molecular scale. However, it has been proposed that complex nonspherical colloidal particles could act as ?colloidal molecules? in mesoscopic model systems to permit the visualization of molecular phenomena that are otherwise difficult to observe. Unfortunately, it is difficult to synthesize such colloids because surface minimization generally favors the growth of symmetric particles. Here we demonstrate the production of large numbers of complex colloids with glancing angle physical vapor deposition. We use chiral colloids to demonstrate the Baranova and Zel?dovich ( Baranova, N. B.; and Zel?dovich, B. Y. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1978, 57, 435) propeller effect: the separation of a racemic mixture by application of a rotating field that couples to the dipole moment of the enantiomers and screw propels them in opposite directions. The handedness of the colloidal suspensions is monitored with circular differential light scattering. An exact solution for the colloid?s propulsion is derived, and comparisons between the colloidal system and the corresponding effect at the molecular scale are made.},

abstract = {Hyper Rayleigh scattering is used to investigate the second harmonic light collected from a liquid suspension of silver metallic particles, the diameter of which ranges from 20 nm up to 80 nm. From the dependence of the quadratic hyperpolarizability as a function of the particle size, it is inferred that retardation effects of the electromagnetic fields play a major role in the frequency conversion process. The hyper Rayleigh scattering intensity was also recorded as a function of the angle of polarization of the incident fundamental wave. For the particles with a diameter of 20 nm, the harmonic response is dominated by the dipolar contribution arising from the deviation of the particle shape from that of a perfect sphere. It is therefore concluded that the origin of the nonlinear polarization for the smaller silver particle sizes arises from the surface similarly to the case of the gold metallic particles. For larger diameter particles, retardation effects in the interaction of the electromagnetic fields with the particles cannot be neglected any longer, and the response deviates from the pure dipolar response, exhibiting a strong quadrupolar contribution. The weighting parameter {\'{u}}V is used, equaling unity for a pure quadrupolar contribution and vanishing for a pure dipolar response, in order to quantify the relative magnitude of these two dipolar and quadrupolar contributions. The size dependence of this parameter obtained for the silver particles is compared to the dependence previously reported for gold metallic particles.},

This chirality formation process models the formation of chiral molecules by association of achiral atoms or functional groups. The local optical activities induced by the association of the achiral nanostructures were investigated using a circular dichroism (CD) nanoimaging technique. The chirality formed with the two approaching achiral partial structures caused enhancement of the local optical activity around the region of their connection when the distance between the achiral partial structures was less than 350 nm. The local optical activity was enhanced even without physical contact of the two partial structures. We therefore concluded that long-range electromagnetic interaction, rather than electronic exchange between the tw...},

Chirality, the property of objects that differ from their mirror image, is also of significance in such fields, and a subject of much current interest. This review offers insight into the intertwining of these topics with a focus on the latest theory. Optical trapping of nanoscale objects involves forward Rayleigh scattering of light involving transition dipole moments; usually these dipoles are assumed to be electric although, in chiral studies, magnetic dipoles must also be considered. It is shown that a system combining optical trapping and chirality could be used to separate enantiomers. Attention is also given to optical binding, which involves light induced interactions between trapped particles. Interesting effects also arise when binding is combined with chirality.},

Here we investigated the circular differential scattering of a simple chiral plasmonic system, a twisted side-by-side Au nanorod dimer, using single-particle circular dichroism spectroscopy complimented with electromagnetic simulations. This approach enabled us to quantify the effects of structural symmetry breaking, namely, size-mismatch between the constituent Au nanorods and large twist angles on the resulting circular differential scattering spectrum. Our results demonstrate that, if only scattering is considered as measured by dark-field spectroscopy, a homodimer of Au nanorods with similar sizes produces a circular differential scattering line shape that is different from the bisignate response of the corresponding conventional CD spectrum, which measures extinction, that is, the sum of scattering and absorption. On the other hand, symmetry breaking in a heterodimer with Au nanorods with different sizes yields a bisignate circular differential scattering line shape.

abstract = {We show theoretically that self-assembled metamaterial suspensions of magnetoplasmonic entities in the form of magnetic-nanoparticle helices coiled around plasmonic (gold) nanorods exhibit very strong magnetochiral dichroism that is orders of magnitude higher than in conventional materials exhibiting this phenomenon (liquid molecular systems, anisotropic crystals, and chiral ferromagnets). The large values of the calculated magnetochirality are accompanied by an enhancement of the magneto-optical Faraday effect due to the excitation of surface plasmons at the nanorods as well as by an increase of the structural dichroism imparted from the helicoidal arrangement of the magnetic nanoparticles. However, the reported enhancement of the magnetochiral dichroism does not appear to be a cascade phenomenon of the structural and magnetic circular dichroism as, for example, in solutions of magnetic compounds, but appears as a possible manifestation of the emergence of a surface-plasmon-induced toroidal moment within the nanoparticle helices. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the presence of a toroidal moment in a material can exhibit significant reciprocity-violating anisotropy in the optical regime.},

abstract = {Three dimensional helical chiral metamaterials resulted in effective manipulation of circularly polarized light in the visible infrared for advanced nanophotonics. Their potentialities are severely limited by the lack of full rotational symmetry preventing broadband operation, high signal-to-noise ratio and inducing high optical activity sensitivity to structure orientation. Complex intertwined three dimensional structures such as multiple-helical nanowires could overcome these limitations, allowing the achievement of several chiro-optical effects combining chirality and isotropy. Here we report three dimensional triple-helical nanowires, engineered by the innovative tomographic rotatory growth, on the basis of focused ion beam-induced deposition. These three dimensional nanostructures show up to 37{\%} of circular dichroism in a broad range (500–1,000 nm), with a high signal-to-noise ratio (up to 24dB). Optical activity of up to 8? only due to the circular birefringence is also shown, tracing the way towards chiral photonic devices that can be integrated in optical nanocircuits to modulate the visible light polarization.},

abstract = {A reconfigurable plasmonic nanosystem combines an active plasmonic structure with a regulated physical or chemical control input. There have been considerable efforts on integration of plasmonic nanostructures with active platforms using top-down techniques. The active media include phase-transition materials, graphene, liquid crystals and carrier-modulated semiconductors, which can respond to thermal, electrical and optical stimuli. However, these plasmonic nanostructures are often restricted to two-dimensional substrates, showing desired optical response only along specific excitation directions. Alternatively, bottom-up techniques offer a new pathway to impart reconfigurability and functionality to passive systems. In particular, DNA has proven to be one of the most versatile and robust building blocks for construction of complex three-dimensional architectures with high fidelity. Here we show the creation of reconfigurable three-dimensional plasmonic metamolecules, which execute DNA-regulated conformational changes at the nanoscale. DNA serves as both a construction material to organize plasmonic nanoparticles in three dimensions, as well as fuel for driving the metamolecules to distinct conformational states. Simultaneously, the three-dimensional plasmonic metamolecules can work as optical reporters, which transduce their conformational changes in situ into circular dichroism changes in the visible wavelength range.},

abstract = {A medium that exhibits artificial magnetism can be formed by assembling an array of split ring resonators (SRRs)-planar conducting elements that exhibit a resonant response to electromagnetic radiation. The SRR exhibits a large magnetic dipole moment when excited by a magnetic field directed along its axis. However, the SRR also exhibits an electric response that can be quite large depending on the symmetry of the SRR and the orientation of the SRR with respect to the electric component of the field. So, while the SRR medium can be considered as having a predominantly magnetic response for certain orientations with respect to the incident wave, it is generally the case that the SRR exhibits magnetoelectric coupling, and hence a medium of SRRs arranged so as to break mirror symmetry about one of the axes will exhibit bianisotropy. We present here a method of directly calculating the magnetoelectric coupling terms using averages over the fields computed from full-wave finite-element based numerical simulations. We confirm the predicted bianisotropy of a fabricated SRR medium by measuring the cross polarization of a microwave beam transmitted through the sample. We also demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling that gives rise to the bianisotropic response is suppressed by symmetrizing the SRR composite structure and provide measurements comparing the cross polarization of the symmetric and asymmetric structures.

However, the biosensing capabilities of these chiral metamaterials have not been fully explored. Ultrasensitive detection and structural characterization of proteins adsorbed on chiral plasmonic substrates was demonstrated recently using UV-visible circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Second harmonic generation microscopy is an extremely sensitive nonlinear optical probe to investigate the chirality of biomaterials. In this study, we characterize the chiral response of chiral plasmonic metamaterials using second harmonic generation microscopy and CD spectroscopy.

abstract = {Abstract Second-harmonic generation can be used to probe chiral properties of surfaces and thin films with in-plane isotropy. We present a general formalism to analyse such chiral effects and apply it to review known effects and to introduce new effects. The formalism is based on expanding the fundamental and second-harmonic fields in terms of their p- and s-polarized components. Each second-harmonic signal can then be described in terms of only three nonlinear coefficients, which are associated with the quadratic combinations of the fundamental-field components. The coefficients can be classified as achiral (allowed for all isotropic surfaces) or chiral (allowed only for chiral surfaces) independent of the details of the nonlinear light-matter interaction. The basic signatures of chirality are intensity-difference effects in which the efficiencies of second-harmonic generation are different for left- and right-hand circularly-polarized light or two orthogonal linear polarizations, for example. These effe...},

Similarly, it has been shown that plasmonic chiral systems exhibit strong circular dichroism (CD) responses that can be used to determine the relative positions of their constituent plasmonic elements. Here we show that the sign of the circular dichroism spectrum in a plasmonic system can be controllably changed through small geometric perturbations that change the energetic ordering of the hybridized modes. This mechanism is distinct from geometrical changes that explicitly change the handedness of the system. In a simple system composed of two stacked L-shaped resonators we observe a reversal of the optical rotation spectral signature for small relative shifts, and we show through electromagnetic modeling and experiments on lithographically patterned samples that this is due to a rearrangement of the relative energies between modes. The plasmonic system allows for geometric perturbation along controlled directions and therefore offers...},

Moreover, in optical metamaterials, chirality leads to negative refractive index and all the promising applications thereof. In this Progress Report, we highlight four different strategies which have been used to achieve giant chiroptical effects in chiral nanostructures. These strategies consecutively highlight the importance of chirality in the nanostructures (for linear and nonlinear chiroptical effects), in the experimental setup and in the light itself. Because, in the future, manipulating chirality will play an important role, we present two examples of chiral switches. Whereas in the first one, switching the chirality of incoming light causes a reversal of the handedness in the nanostructures, in the second one, switching the handedness of the nanostructures causes a reversal in the chirality of outgoing light.},

Analysis of the C-SHG adsorption isotherms reveals Frumkin adsorption behavior with a positive interaction energy. The binding constant (Ka) obtained was determined to be (8.3 +/- 1.0) x 105 M-1.

Interestingly, the number of Au NPs in the assemblies had a significant influence on the shape and intensity of the CD line. The assemblies were enzymatically disassembled by deoxyribonudease I (DNase I), and the CD responses were simultaneously reversed. With the proof-of-concept design, the PCD response was no change by addding enzyme inhibitor. These experiments suggested that the chirality depended upon the structure of core satellites nanoassemblies, and the results clarify that the possible origin of the optical activity comes from chiral arrangement of building blocks and Coulomb dipole dipole interactions. This research also illuminated that the assemblies can be used to develop a new sensor for the sensitive screening of the enzyme inhibitors.},

Many achievements in the fabrication of such devices have been made over the last decade, but most of the established methods are still restricted to light intensity distribution with different structural shapes and minor attention has been devoted to exploit the vectorial nature of the light coupled with the response of polarization sensitive materials. Here, supramolecular chiral structuring in an amorphous azo-polymer is demonstrated, coupling the strong and diversified photoresponse of the material with the holographic recording of 2D polarization patterns. The smart polymer organization guided by the complex light field induces periodic chiral microstructures, with spiral- or ribbon-like shape and identical or opposite helicity, characterized by high stability and complete reconfigurability. The holographic structures are theoretically described by means of the Jones matrix method and experimentally investigated, confirming the simultaneous presence of both linear and circular photoinduced anisotropies. These results prove an alternative approach to design a new class of materials with periodic chiral arrangement.},

abstract = {Chiral plasmonic nanostructures exhibit strong rotatory optical activity and are expected to enrich the field of metaoptical materials. Potential applications of chiroplasmonic nanostructures include circular polarizers, optical polarization detectors, asymmetric catalysts, and sensors. However, chiral plasmonic materials require subwavelength structural control and involve laborious chemical or lithographic procedures for their manufacturing. Moreover, strong rotatory activity of subwavelength structures whose chirality was imparted by microfabrication, has been obtained for the red and infrared parts of the spectrum but faces new challenges for the blue and violet spectral ranges even with plasmonic materials with plasmonic bands in the 200-400 nm window. In this study, we address this problem by preparing chiral subwavelength nanostructures by glancing angle sputtering of metallic silver on ZnO nanopillar arrays. Silver deposition in two different planes is a convenient method for preparation of silver chiroplasmonic nanocaps (Ag CPNCs) with controlled asymmetry. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine the circular extinction for the left-handed nanocaps (L-CPNCs) with understanding that not only circular dichroism but also many other optical effects contribute to the amplitude of these bands. The pillared silver films exhibit circular extinction in the violet area of the electromagnetic spectrum. Partial oxidation of Ag to AgxO causes the absorption and corresponding circular extinction band obtained using a conventional CD spectrometer at 400-525 nm to increase and shift. This optical material may be used to detect oxygen and extends the spectrum of application of chiroplasmonic materials to gas sensing.},

abstract = {We present a novel method of machining optical fiber surfaces with a CO2 laser for use in Fiber-based Fabry-Perot Cavities (FFPCs). Previously FFPCs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short cavity lengths (≤ 200 $\mu$m). These characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long cavity lengths. By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser's transverse mode profile is eliminated. Consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with a high degree of rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence. Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs.},

abstract = {The nature of the excited state renders the development of chiral catalysts for enantioselective photochemical reactions a considerable challenge. The absorption of a 400 nm photon corresponds to an energy uptake of approximately 300 kJ mol(-1) . Given the large distance to the ground state, innovative concepts are required to open reaction pathways that selectively lead to a single enantiomer of the desired product. This Review outlines the two major concepts of homogenously catalyzed enantioselective processes. The first part deals with chiral photocatalysts, which intervene in the photochemical key step and induce an asymmetric induction in this step. In the second part, reactions are presented in which the photochemical excitation is mediated by an achiral photocatalyst and the transfer of chirality is ensured by a second chiral catalyst (dual catalysis).},

This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the physics of quantum noise and its connections to quantum measurement and quantum amplification. After introducing quantum noise spectra and methods for their detection, we describe the basics of weak continuous measurements. Particular attention is given to treating the standard quantum limit on linear amplifiers and position detectors using a general linear-response framework. We show how this approach relates to the standard Haus-Caves quantum limit for a bosonic amplifier known in quantum optics, and illustrate its application for the case of electrical circuits, including mesoscopic detectors and resonant cavity detectors.},

While the coupling between solid-solid and inverse-inverse plasmonic structures is well-understood, mixed solid-inverse systems have not yet been studied in detail. In particular, it remains unclear whether or not an efficient coupling is even possible and which prerequisites have to be met. We find that an efficient coupling between inverse and solid resonances is indeed possible, identify the necessary geometrical prerequisites, and demonstrate a novel solid-inverse plasmonic electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) structure as well as a mixed chiral system. We furthermore show that for the coupling of asymmetric rod-shaped inverse and solid structures symmetry breaking is crucial. In contrast, highly symmetric structures such as nanodisks and nanoholes are straightforward to couple. Our results constitute a significant extension of the plasmonic coupling toolkit, and we thus envision the emergence of a large number of intriguing novel plasmonic coupling phenomena in mixed solid-inverse structures.},

CdS nanocrystals capped with penicillamine enantiomers were prepared and found to be both highly luminescent and optically active. No new features in circular dichroism were observed as the nanocrystal grew larger. Density functional calculations reveal that penicillamine strongly distorts surface Cd, transmitting an enantiomeric structure to the surface layers and associated electronic states. The quantum dot core is found to remain undistorted and achiral.},

abstract = {Arago's discovery in 1811 of natural optical activity in chiral crystals and Faraday's discovery in 1846 of magnetically induced optical activity have contributed much to our understanding of the wave nature of light and the electronic properties of molecules. Both effects are manifest as a rotation in the polarization of transmitted light: the former is due to the intrinsic properties of media that lack mirror symmetry, whereas the latter (which occurs in all materials) is due to magnetic-field-induced changes in the optical properties. The apparent similarity of these two effects motivated Pasteur to search in vain for a link between the two phenomena. Such a link—which can be regarded as arising either from a magnetically induced change of natural optical activity or from the difference in magnetic optical activity of the two enantiomers of a chiral medium—has been predicted to exist, although it is expected to be very weak. Here we report the experimental observation of this 'magneto-chiral' optical effect and a demonstration of its enantioselectivity. The existence of this effect may be important in the context of fundamental interactions between light and matter, and in molecular spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Metal-helix based metamaterials have been introduced as compact and broadband circular polarizers. However, the end of the metal wire together with the helix center defines an axis in space, which unavoidably breaks the rotational symmetry at the metamaterial surface. This introduces linear birefringence. Symmetry can be recovered by considering an integer number, e.g. N = 4, of intertwined helices arranged to a square array. We show that the operation principles are fundamentally different though. Metamaterial circular polarizers based on N = 4 helices, unlike single helices, inherently require absorption of the constituent metal. Otherwise, the combination of a four-fold rotational axis and time-inversion symmetry strictly forbids circular-polarizer action. Our symmetry analysis is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations comparing results for perfect electric conductors with those for a free-electron Drude metal with finite damping.},

Several fundamental studies designed to elucidate the molecular and macromolecular origins of the chiral responses are reviewed to provide a framework for development of this emerging field. In general, the chiral activity in SHG and SFG has the potential to arise from complex interactions between hosts of different competing effects. Fortunately, relatively simple electric dipole-allowed mechanisms routinely dominate the nonlinear optical chiral activities of most practical systemsexpressions can often be generated to link the. This substantial reduction in complexity allows for the development of simple models connecting the macroscopic nonlinear optical response to intuitive molecular and supramolecular properties.},

abstract = {A solid-state dedicated circular dichroism (CD) spectrophotometer (J-800KCM) was designed and constructed. As a CD spectrophotometer is a polarization-modulation instrument, CD spectra are necessarily accompanied by artifacts due to macroscopic anisotropies such as linear birefringence (LB) and linear dichroism (LD) which are unique to the solid state. A photomultiplier with the least polarization characteristics and a photoelastic modulator (PEM) with the least residual static birefringence were selected for the new instrument, which was based on the electrical and optical systems of a commercially available spectrophotometer. A phased-locked loop circuit was introduced to a PEM driver, and a sample rotation holder, a stage controller, and an analyzer were installed. We have designed and built a special solid-state sample holder to enable the cancellation of artifact CD, and a lens unit for smaller samples. A set of procedures for obtaining true CD has been devised based on the Mueller matrix method, and a program was written to facilitate the otherwise cumbersome measurements. Using the J-800KCM instrument and this approach, we could obtain nearly zero CD for achiral polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film dyed with achiral Congo Red by cancelling the substantial apparent CD arising from large macroscopic anisotropies. Experiments on chiral single crystals of alpha -Ni(H2O)(6). SO4, one with larger and one with smaller LB, have established that, by our method, we could also eliminate parasitic artifacts to obtain the true CD. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

The investigated structures consist of an array of high-permittivity rods that exhibit a series of Mie resonances giving rise to the effective magnetic response. The spectral positions of resonances depend on the geometrical parameters of the rods and on their permittivity, which define the resonant confinement of the electromagnetic field within the rods. The electromagnetic coupling between the adjacent rods is negligible. With a suitable aspect ratio of the rods, a broadband magnetic response can be obtained.},

abstract = {In recent years, optical chirality of plasmonic nanostructures has aroused great interest because of innovative fundamental understanding as well as promising potential applications in optics, catalysis and sensing. Herein, state-of-the-art studies on circular dichroism (CD) characteristics of plasmonic nanostructures are summarized. The hybrid of achiral plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and chiral molecules is explored to generate a new CD response at the plasmon resonance as well as the enhanced CD intensity of chiral molecules in the UV region, owing to the Coulomb static and dynamic dipole interactions between plasmonic NPs and chiral molecules. As for chiral assembly of plasmonic NPs, plasmon-plasmon interactions between the building blocks are found to induce generation of intense CD response at the plasmon resonance. Three-dimensional periodical arrangement of plasmonic NPs into macroscale chiral metamaterials is further introduced from the perspective of negative refraction and photonic bandgap. A strong CD signal is also discerned in achiral planar plasmonic nanostructures under illumination of circular polarized plane wave at oblique incidence or input vortex beam at normal incidence. Finally perspectives, especially on future investigation of time-resolved CD responses, are presented.},

This reaction is faster than the well-known core etching. Surprisingly, if a chiral thiol is exchanged for its opposite enantiomer, the optical activity in the metal-based electronic transitions is reversed although the form of the CD spectra remains largely unchanged. The extent of inversion corresponds to the overall ee of the chiral ligand in the system. This shows that the chiral arrangement of metal atoms in the metal particle (surface) can not withstand the driving force imposed by the ligand of opposite absolute configuration. If the incoming thiol has a different structure, the electronic transitions in the metal core are slightly modified whereas the absorption onset remains unchanged. These results emphasize the influence of the thiols on the structure of the gold nanoparticles and give insight on the ligand exchange pathways.},

We find that strong interaction between the chiral molecule and OAM can be induced by the excitation of plasmon resonances. An experimental scheme to observe such an interaction has been proposed. Furthermore, we have found that the signal of the OAM dichroism can be either positive or negative, depending on the spatial positions of nanocomposites in the cross-sections of OAM beams. The cancellation between positive and negative signals in the spatial average can explain why the interaction has not been observed in former experiments.},

abstract = {Au-nanoclusters between 2 and 8 nm in diameter were deposited onto solid substrates in different pattern geometries. The basis of this approach is the self-assembly of polystyrene-b-poly[2-vinylpyridine (HAuCl4)] diblock copolymer micelles into uniform monomicellar films on solid supports such as Si-wafers or glass cover slips. HAuCl4 as metallic precursor or a single solid Au-nanoparticle caused by reduction of the precursor are embedded in the centre of diblock copolymer micelles. Subsequent hydrogen, oxygen or argon gas plasma treatment of the dry film causes deposition of Au-nanoparticles onto the substrate by entire removal of the polymer. The Au-dot patterns resemble the micellar patterns before the plasma treatment. Separation distances between the dots is controlled by the molecular weight of the diblock copolymers. The limitation of the separation distance between individual dots or the pattern geometry is overcome by combining self-assembly of diblock copolymer micelles with pre-structures formed by photo or e-beam lithography. Capillary forces of a retracting liquid film due to solvent evaporation on the pre-structured substrate push micelles in the corners of these defined topographies. A more direct process is demonstrated by applying monomicellar films as negative e-beam resist. Micelles that are irradiated by electrons are chemically modified and can hardly be dissolved from the substrate while non-exposed micelles can be lifted-off by suitable solvents. This process is also feasible on electrical isolating substrates such as glass cover slips if the monomicellar film is coated in addition with a 5 nm thick conductive layer of carbon before e-beam treatment. The application of cylindrical block copolymer micelles also allows for the formation of 4 nm wide lines which can be 1–50 µm long and also be organized in defined aperiodic structures.},

The polarization response is found to reverse for opposite enantiomers, and also for the same enantiomer when it is illuminated from opposite sides of the structure. In addition, the polarization states of the various diffracted beams are found to be non-reversible. These structures therefore appear to display elements of non-reciprocal behaviour. The polarization responses of complementary designs, different chiral geometries and various silicon nitride film thicknesses have also been studied. As a result we conclude that multiple reflections within the patterned silicon nitride layer play an important role in defining the mechanism by which these structures are able to modify the polarization states of diffracted light.},

abstract = {The Coulombic interaction between a chiral molecule and a nonchiral metal nanocrystal creates new plasmonic lines in a circular dichroism (CD) spectrum. In many cases, optical lines in CD spectra of chiral molecules and plasmon absorption bands in metal nanocrystals are not in resonance. Typically, CD lines of chiral molecules are in the UV spectral range, whereas plasmon bands of metal nanocrystals are in the visible range. Nevertheless, plasmon excitations can strongly interact with dipoles of chiral molecules and become chiral. We demonstrate this effect theoretically and derive a general equation for the CD spectrum of a complex composed of metal nanocrystals and a single chiral molecule. In our theory, new plasmon peaks in the CD spectra come from an effect of interference between external and induced fields inside a hybrid complex. Ourmodels involve single spherical nanoparticles, nanoparticle pairs, and nanoshells. The results obtained here can be used to design new optical materials and hybrid nanosystems with sensor properties.},

The complexation processes can be followed very conveniently by the induced circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The binding constants as determined by CD titration increase in the order 15 (steroidal monool, K = 8.7 M-1) {\textless} 3, 6, and 8 (acyclic glycols, (4.9-7.1 x 10) {\textless} 9-alpha, 10-alpha, 12, and 13 (cyclic glycols and steroidal diols, (0.94-2.7) x 10(2)) {\textless} 11 (steroidal triol, 6.9 x 10(2)). This order reflects the extents of multiple host-guest hydrogen-bonding interactions. All of the resulting complexes exhibit CD with split Cotton effects as a result of exciton chirality induction in otherwise symmetric 1 upon binding of a chiral guest. The signs of split Cotton effects for complexes derived from glycols are correlated with the chiralities or absolute configurations of the guests, while those for sugar complexes are governed by the ring conformations (C1 or 1C) of sugar pyranoses. These results suggest that host 1 can be used as a novel, supramolecular probe for the assignments of stereochemistry of chiral guests.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This review serves to describe the physical theory of LSPR formation at the surface of nanostructures, and the potential for this optical technology to serve as a basis for the development bioassays and biosensing of high sensitivity.

abstract = {Plasmonic chirality has drawn much attention because of tunable circular dichroism (CD) and the enhancement of chiral molecule signals. Although various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the plasmonic CD, a quantitative explanation like the ab initio mechanism for chiral molecules, is still unavailable. In this study, a mechanism similar to the mechanisms associated with chiral molecules was analyzed. The giant extrinsic circular dichroism of a plasmonic splitting rectangle ring was quantitatively investigated from a theoretical standpoint. The interplay of the electric and magnetic modes of the meta-structure is proposed to explain the giant CD. We analyzed the interplay using both an analytical coupled electric-magnetic dipoles model and a finite element method model. The surface charge distributions showed that the circular current yielded by the splitting rectangle ring causes the ring to behave like a magneton at some resonant modes, which then interact with electric modes, resulting in a mixing of the two types of modes. The strong interplay of the two mode types is primarily responsible for the giant CD. The analysis of the chiral near-field of the structure shows potential applications for chiral molecule sensing.},

Applications range from surface growth and deposition to elucidating the details of chemical reactions through controlled collisions. The critical challenge faced by many experiments is the production of a beam of particles with a narrow velocity spread, a precisely controlled mean velocity, and sufficient flux over a wide range. We demonstrate this fine control of velocity using strong optical fields that trap and accelerate particles up to velocities of hundreds of metres per second. This acceleration occurs over tens of nanoseconds and on micrometre length scales. Particle velocity can be continuously tuned over a wide range while maintaining a narrow velocity spread. Our method is very general and will allow acceleration or deceleration of a wide variety of neutral atomic and molecular species, as well as nanoscale particles},

The evident broad-band circular dichroism of the metamaterial is not a result of the intrinsic handeness of the constituent meta-atoms as in mainstream chiral designs but arises from the combined action of the anisotropy of each array of chains of nanoparticles, the gradual rotational twist of the metamaterial, and the strong electromagnetic coupling between adjacent layers of nanoparticle chains. As such, it is shown numerically that the degree of circular dichroism of the twisted metamaterial under study depends strongly on the twist angle between two successive lattices of nanoparticle chains and on the degree of anisotropy of each lattice.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence of new measurement approaches and applications for chiral thin films and materials enabled by the observations of the high sensitivity of second-order nonlinear optical measurements to chirality. In thin films, the chiral response to second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation (SFG) from a single molecular monolayer is often comparable with the achiral response. The chiral specificity also allows for symmetry-allowed SFG in isotropic chiral media, confirming predictions made approximately 50 years ago. With these experimental demonstrations in hand, an important challenge is the construction of intuitive predictive models that allow the measured chiral response to be meaningfully related back to molecular and macromolecular structure. This review defines and considers three distinct mechanisms for chiral effects in uniaxially oriented assemblies: orientational chirality, intrinsic chirality, and isotropic chirality. The role of each is discussed in experimental and computational studies of bacteriorhodopsin films, binaphthol, and collagen. Collectively, these three model systems support a remarkably simple framework for quantitatively recovering the measured chiral-specific activity.},

abstract = {The optical constants n and k were obtained for the noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) from reflection and transmission measurements on vacuum-evaporated thin films at room temperature, in the spectral range 0.5- 6.5 eV. The film-thickness range was 185-500 A. Three optical measurements were inverted to obtain the film thickness d as well as g and k. 0 The estimated error in d was +-2 A, and that in n, k was less than 0 02 over most of the spectral range. The results in the film-thickness range 250-500 A were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. The free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. The interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution. Some recent theoretical calculations are compared with the results for copper and gold. In addition, some other recent experiments are critically compared with our results.},

The results show that the TPL and SHG intensity of gold plates is dependent on the wavelength and polarization of excitation laser. The TPL intensity of gold plates decreases with the increase of the excitation wavelength except for a small peak around 820–840 nm, while SHG intensity increases with the excitation wavelength redshift. In addition, it is found that the TPL intensity of the gold plate's edge is related with the angle between the edge orientation and the polarization direction of the excitation light. The TPL intensity increases with the angle increase from 0° to 90°.},

A simple analytical model for this metamaterial response shows how the reflectivity spectrum scales with the metal fill fraction and the refractive index of the material that the metallic nanostructure is embedded in. The ultrafast response arising from the interconnected three-dimensional nanostructure can be separated into electronic and lattice contributions with strong spectral dependences on the dielectric filling of the gyroids, which invert the sign of the nonlinear transient reflectivity changes. These metamaterials thus provide a wide variety of tunable nonlinear optical properties, which can be utilized for frequency mixing, optical switching, phase modulators, novel emitters, and enhanced sensing.},

For a long time, optical circular dichroism has been exclusively the terrain of natural chiral molecules, which exhibit optical activity mainly in the UV spectral range, thus greatly hindering their significance for a broad range of applications. Here we demonstrate that circular dichroism can be generated with artificial plasmonic chiral nanostructures composed of the minimum number of spherical gold nanoparticles required for three-dimensional (3D) chirality. We utilize a rigid addressable DNA origami template to precisely organize four nominally identical gold nanoparticles into a three-dimensional asymmetric tetramer. Because of the chiral structural symmetry and the strong plasmonic resonant coupling between the gold nanoparticles, the 3D plasmonic assemblies undergo different interactions with left and right circularly polarized light, leading to pronounced circular dichroism. Our experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions. The simplicity of our structure geometry and, most importantly, the concept of resorting on biology to produce artificial photonic functionalities open a new pathway to designing smart artificial plasmonic nanostructures for large-scale production of optically active metamaterials.},

In particular, it is shown that the magnetic response of a metal-dielectric metamaterial is always diamagnetic at imaginary frequencies, and this explains in simple physical terms the impossibility of Casimir repulsion.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that a lateral optical force (LOF) can be induced on paired chiral nanoparticles with opposite hand-edness under the illumination of a linearly polarized plane wave. The LOFs on both chiral particles are equal and thus can move the pair sideways, with the direction depending on the separation between two particles, as well as the hand-edness of particle chirality. Analytical theory reveals that the LOF comes largely from the optical potential gradient established by the multiple scattering of light between the paired particles with asymmetric chirality. In addition, it is weakly dependent on the material loss of a particle, a feature of gradient force, while heavily dependent on the magnitude and handedness of particle chirality. The effect is expected to find applications in sorting and separating chiral dimers of different handedness.},

abstract = {A concise method is proposed to fabricate L-shaped Ag nanostructures (LSANs) for generating chirality. Prepared by glancing angle deposition, the LSAN composed of two slices with different thickness is stacked on self-assembled monolayer polystyrene nanosphere arrays by controlling substrate azimuth and deposition time. The strong optical chirality of LSANs is achieved in visible and near-IR regions by measurement. For the circular dichroism spectrum of LSANs, the intensity is enlarged, and its peaks red-shift with increasing thickness difference. When LSANs are stacked on polystyrene spheres of different diameters, enlargement and red-shift are also observed in their circular dichroism spectra with increasing thickness difference. The numerical calculations of finite element method show that the two slices composing LSAN provide cross-electric dipoles and their thickness difference provides phase difference for generating optical chirality. This study not only provides a concise and scalable method for fabricating chiral plasmonic nanostructures but also contributes to understand the knowledge of the mechanism of circular dichroism.},

abstract = {Chirality in materials and light is of abiding interest across a broad range of scientific disciplines. This article discusses present and emerging issues in relation to molecular and optical chirality, also including some important developments in chiral metamaterials. Quantifying the chirality of matter or light leads to issues concerning the most appropriate measures, such as a helicity parameter for specific chiral chromophores and technical measures of light chirality. An optical helicity and chirality density depend on a difference between the numbers of left- and right-handed photons in a beam. In connection with circularly polarised luminescence, adoption of the Stokes parameter to spontaneous emission from chiral molecules invites critical attention. Modern spectroscopic techniques are often based on the different response arising from left-handed circularly polarised light compared to right-handed light. This dissimilarity can be exploited as a foundation for the separation of chiral molecules, promising new avenues of application.},

abstract = {Based on a new, more complete form of macroscopic Maxwell equations, we discuss its influence on the studies of metamaterials, where coexisting electric and magnetic polarizations make unusual EM responses. The new scheme is derived by applying a long-wavelength approximation to the fundamental equations of microscopic non-local response theory, and it requires only one susceptibility tensor chicm (omega, k) to take care of all the electric and magnetic polarizations and their mutual interference in the different-order terms of the wave vector k. This scheme reduces to the conventional one in the absence of chiral symmetry, while the Drude-Born-Fedorov equations for the phenomenological description of a chiral medium turn out to be incorrect near the resonance frequency. In the conventional description of a non-chiral medium in terms of {\&}epsiv; and mu, it is required to use the magnetic susceptibility defined with respect, not to H, but to B with poles at magnetic transition energies.

A polar mapping strategy was used for providing direct evidence for the emergence of light of different polarization angles when chiral GNR aggregates were excited with circularly polarized light of different handedness. Further, we have developed a methodology to eliminate fluctuations in the scattering intensity by averaging and normalizing the data.

abstract = {Because of its high surface and interface sensitivity, the nonlinear optical technique of second harmonic generation (SHG) is a designated method for investigating nanostructured metal surfaces. Indeed, the latter present a high surface-to-volume ratio, but even more importantly, they can exhibit strong near-field enhancements or "hot spots". Hot spots often appear as a result of geometric features on the nanoscale or surface plasmon resonances, which are collective electron oscillations on the surface that, on the nanoscale, can readily be excited by light. In the last 10 years, near-field hot spots have been responsible for dramatic developments in the field of nano-optics. In this Feature Article, the influence of hot spots on the SHG response of nanostructured metal surfaces is discussed on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. On the microscopic level, the nanostructured metal surfaces were characterized by scanning SHG microscopy, complemented by rigorous numerical simulations of the near-field and of the local electric currents at the fundamental frequency. On the macroscopic level, SHG-circular dichroism and magnetization-induced SHG characterization techniques were employed.},

It also addresses stronger chiroptical effects obtained in intrinsically chiral inorganic nanostructures obtained from growing enantiomeric excess of intrinsically chiral NCs or arranging achiral plasmonic particles in chiral configurations. The accumulated experimental data and theory on various CD induction mechanisms provide an extended set of tools to properly analyze and understand the electromagnetic influence of chiral molecules on inorganic particles and obtain new general insights into the interaction of capping molecules with inorganic NCs. Among the field-induced CD mechanisms developed recently one can name the Coulomb (near-field, dipolar) mechanism for nanostructures much smaller than the wavelength, and for larger nanostructures, the electromagnetic (effective chiral medium), and intrinsically chiral plasmonic mechanisms.},

Chiral molecules can impart optical activity to achiral materials in the form of the particle's electronic transition frequency.

This interaction produces a CD signal at the plasmon resonance frequency (∼520 nm) of the chiral peptide-nanoparticle complex. Aggregation of the peptide-coated nanoparticles using metal ions results in a red-shifted plasmonic CD response.

abstract = {We describe from the theoretical point of view a plasmonic mechanism of optical activity in chiral complexes composed of metal nanoparticles (NPs). In our model, the circular dichroism (CD) signal comes from the Coulomb interaction between NPs. We show that the CD spectrum is very sensitive to the geometry and composition of a chiral complex and also has typically both positive and negative bands. In our calculations, the strongest CD signals were found for the helix geometry resembling helical structures of many biomolecules. For chiral tetramers and pyramids, the symmetry of a frame of a complex is very important for the formation of a strong CD response. Chiral natural molecules (peptides, DNA, etc.) often have strong CD signals in the UV range and typically show weak CD responses in the visible range of photon energies. In contrast to the natural molecules, the described mechanism of plasmonic CD is able to create strong CD signals in the visible wavelength range. This plasmonic mechanism offers a unique possibility to design colloidal and other nanostructures with strong optical chirality.},

Cavity optomechanical systems, in which a high-quality optical resonator is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator, hold great promise as a route towards the observation of such effects with macroscopic oscillators. Here, we present measurements on optomechanical systems exhibiting radiofrequency (62-122 MHz) mechanical modes, cooled to very low occupancy using a combination of cryogenic precooling and resolved-sideband laser cooling. The lowest achieved occupancy is n similar to 63. Optical measurements of these ultracold oscillators' motion are shown to perform in a near-ideal manner, exhibiting an imprecision-backaction product about one order of magnitude lower than the results obtained with nano-electromechanical transducers.},

abstract = {The widespread availability of spatially and temporally coherent laser sources makes the production of optical vortices inevitable in any experiment involving scattered laser light. The realization of quantized vortices is not specific to optics: these objects occur in all spatial scalar fields. Although optical vortices are often referred to as “points of phase singularity within a cross section of the field,” physical optical fields extend over three dimensions, and the phase singularities are actually lines of perfect destructive interference that are embedded in the volume filled by the light. Optical vortices are examples of the singularity lines within all complicated scalar fields. By comparison, electromagnetic vector fields do not generally have nodes in all components simultaneously. However, vector fields possess singularities associated with the parameterization of elliptical and partial polarization rather than phase. Polarization singularities are present in many situations, ranging from sunlight to the light transmitted by birefringent materials. Their descriptors are more complicated than their scalar counterpart in that they have both handedness and additional categorization. The study of optical vortices and orbital angular momentum has led to a recognition that the energy flow—characterized by the Poynting vector—has features not immediately apparent from the intensity alone, nor from global properties of a beam.},

abstract = {The unique optical characteristics of noble metal nanostructures have their origin principally in surface plasmon resonances. To exploit and design the unique characteristics arising from plasmons, an investigation of optical field structures adjacent to the nanostructure is of fundamental importance. As the spatial scale of the optical field structures is essentially smaller than the radiation wavelength in resonance with the plasmon, optical imaging methods that achieve spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit of light are necessary to visualise the fields. In this article, we review the studies of direct experimental visualisation of plasmon resonances using near-field optical microscopy. We briefly describe the method of near-field optical microscopy used to study noble metal nanoparticles and show with several typical single gold nanoparticles that the spatial features of plasmon resonances, in particular the standing wave functions of the plasmons, can be directly visualised by near-field imaging. We then describe our recent efforts to visualise ultrafast dynamics in metal nanostructures following plasmonic excitation, which are based on near-field ultrafast imaging measurements. Another notable aspect of metal nanostructures that has attracted attention recently is the chirality of plasmons. Here, we describe a method and examples of near-field optical imaging and analyses of chiral plasmons excited on metal nanostructures.},

Since their introduction in 1986, the optical tweezer has become an important tool for research in the fields of biology, physical chemistry and soft condensed matter physics. Recent advances promise to take optical tweezers out of the laboratory and into the mainstream of manufacturing and diagnostics; they may even become consumer products.

abstract = {We theoretically investigated third harmonic generation (THG) from planar chiral metamaterials consisting of a square array of gammadion-shaped metal-insulator-metal multilayered nanostructures. We show that there exists strong circular dichroism (CD) for THG on the proposed chiral metamaterials. We also demonstrate that geometrically mirroring the gammadion -shaped meta-atoms can result in reversal of the THG-CD effect. Based on these CD effects in the optical nonlinear regime, we propose a design of a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) for intense focusing of the THG signals, in which adjacent zones of the FZP consist of gammadions with mirror symmetry and generate circularly polarized THG with opposite handedness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relative phase of the THG can be continuously changed by rotating the gammadion around its rotational axis, which could be used in the FZP to control the polarization of the output THG signals.},

abstract = {This review discusses research on the plasmonic properties of small clusters of metal nanoparticles, with two and three particles. These are the simplest examples of 'plasmonic molecules'. Coupling between two particles leads to new surface plasmon resonances and to the creation of a hot spot of a strong electric field in the gap between the particles. Such a hot spot can be used to enhance Raman scattering or fluorescence, making plasmonic dimers useful for applications in spectroscopy and sensing. Trimers offer a richer spectrum of options for coupling between particles, which can be analyzed using group theory to obtain the plasmonic modes, in analogy to vibrational modes. Symmetry plays an important role in our understanding of the physics of plasmonic dimers and trimers, and new physical phenomena may appear when the symmetry of a dimer or a trimer is broken, including directional emission, Fano resonances, plane chirality and more. The review introduces some of these concepts, the basic physics behind them and their possible applications. Focus Point sections describing selected outstanding recent developments accompany the review.},

CDMS is the preferential Mie scattering of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light by nanoparticles whose sizes are about the same as the wavelength of light. Solving the Mie scattering theory for chiral media, we find that the CDMS signal of the particle is linearly proportional to the chirality parameter $\kappa$ of the molecules. This linear amplitude enhancement by CDMS of the particle holds, even for large particles, which have a retardation effect. We also demonstrate that the CDMS of a nanoparticle is sensitive to changes of molecular concentration, and that the nanoparticle can be utilized as a chiroptical biosensor detecting the concentration of analyte. We expect that the enhancement of molecular chiroptical signals by CDMS will pave the way for novel chiroptical spectroscopy using nanostructures.},

Three-dimensional geometries may provide a wider set of functionalities, including broadband chirality to manipulate circular polarization at the nanoscale, but their fabrication becomes challenging as their dimensions get smaller. Here we introduce a new paradigm for the realization of optical metamaterials, showing that three-dimensional effects may be obtained without complicated inclusions, but instead by tailoring the relative orientation within the lattice. We apply this concept to realize planarized, broadband bianisotropic metamaterials as stacked nanorod arrays with a tailored rotational twist. Because of the coupling among closely spaced twisted plasmonic metasurfaces, metamaterials realized with conventional lithography may effectively operate as three-dimensional helical structures with broadband bianisotropic optical response. The proposed concept is also shown to relax alignment requirements common in three-dimensional metamaterial designs. The realized sample constitutes an ultrathin, broadband circular polarizer that may be directly integrated within nanophotonic systems.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate direct imaging and selective excitation of the bonding and antibonding plasmon mode in symmetric dipole nanoantennas using confocal two-photon photoluminescence mapping. Excitation of a high-quality-factor antibonding resonance manifests itself as a two-lobed pattern instead of the single spot observed for the broad bonding resonance in accordance with numerical simulations. The two-lobed pattern is observed due to the fact that excitation of the antibonding mode is forbidden for symmetric excitation at the feedgap, while concomitantly the mode energy splitting is large enough to suppress excitation of the bonding mode. The controlled excitation of modes in strongly coupled plasmonic nanostructures is mandatory for efficient sensors, in coherent control as well as for implementing well-defined functionalities in complex plasmonic devices.},

In the electromagnetic fields radiated from a suitably chiral source, such as a low-symmetry chiral molecule undergoing radiative decay, optical helicity is exhibited in the extent of a difference in left-and right-handed circular polarization compo-nents. There are several practical measures for quantifying the emergence of ensuing optical helicity, exhibiting different forms of dependence on the properties of the emitter and the positioning of a detector. By casting each measure in terms of an irreducible helicity density, connections and distinctions can be drawn between results expressible in either classical or quantum form.},

This probe proved successful for chirality sensing of several compounds, but in situ IR monitoring of the condensation reaction between the salicylaldehyde moiety in 1 and phenylglycinol showed that the imine formation takes 2 h. Optimization of the substrate binding rate and the circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence readouts led to the replacement of anthracene with smaller fluorophores capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 1-(3'-Formyl-4'-methoxyphenyl)-8-(4'-isoquinolyl)naphthalene N-oxide (2) and its pyridyl analogue 3 combine fast substrate binding with distinctive chiral amplification. This asymmetric transformation of the first kind prompts CD and fluorescence responses that can be used for in situ determination of the absolute configuration, ee, and total concentration of many compounds. The general utility of the three chemosensors was successfully tested on 18 substrates.},

The new technique, hyper‐Rayleigh scattering in solution [K. Clays and A. Persoons, Phys. Rev.

No electric field is needed to lower the intrinsic symmetry of the isotropic solution, leading to a simpler cell design and a simpler local field factor. The internal reference method, when applicable, completely eliminates the local field factor. With the technique presented, values of the first hyperpolarizability $\beta$ of 23×10-30 esu for para‐nitroaniline (PNA), 105×10-30 esu for 4‐methoxy‐4'‐nitrostilbene (MONS), and 95×10-30 esu for 4‐hydroxy‐4'‐nitrostilbene (HONS) dissolved in chloroform have been obtained.},

Many natural molecules and biomolecules are chiral and exhibit remarkably strong optical chirality (circular dichroism) due to their amazingly uniform atomic composition in a large ensemble. It is challenging to realize artificial nanoscale systems with optical chirality since the atomic structure of artificial nanostructures may not be always controlled or even known. Nevertheless, the artificial optical chirality has been accomplished and it is the main scope of this review. In particular, we discuss assemblies incorporating chiral molecules, metal nanocrystals, and semiconductor quantum dots.

abstract = {Silver nanoparticles were prepared in aqueous solutions of chiral supramolecular structures made of chiral molecular building blocks. While these chiral molecules display negligible circular dichroism (CD) as isolated molecules, their stacking produced a significant CD response at room temperature, which could be eliminated by heating to 80 °C due to disordering of the stacks. The chiral stack-plasmon coupling has induced CD at the surface plasmon resonance absorption band of the silver nanoparticles. Switching between two plasmonic CD induction mechanisms was observed: (1) Small Ag nanoparticles coated with large molecular stacks, where the induced plasmonic CD decayed together with the UV molecular CD bands on heating the solution, indicating some type of electromagnetic or dipole coupling mechanism. (2) Larger Ag nanoparticles coated with about a monolayer of molecules exhibited induced plasmonic CD that was temperature-independent. In this case it is estimated that the low chiroptical response of a molecular monolayer is incapable of inducing such a large chiroptical effect, and a model calculation shows that the plasmonic CD response may be the result of a slight chiral shape distortion of the silver nanoparticles.},

The SHG responses of individual nanodimers are found to vary by about a factor of five. The technique thus has very high sensitivity to the nanoscale deformations of the structure. The chiral signatures of the dimers, however, are found to be more uniform, and the technique is thus able to recognize the handedness of the twisted nanodimers with high reliability.},

abstract = {Advances in the measurement, calculation, and application of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) for the determination of absolute configuration are described. The purpose of the review is to provide an up-to-date perspective on the capability of VCD to solve problems of absolute stereochemistry for chiral molecules primarily in the solution state. The scope of the article covers the experimental methods needed for the accurate measurement of VCD spectra and the theoretical steps required to systematically deduce absolute configuration. Determination of absolute configuration of a molecule by VCD requires knowledge of its conformation or conformational distribution, and hence VCD analysis necessarily provides solution-state conformation information, in many cases available by no other method, as an additional benefit. Comparisons of the advantages and limitations of VCD relative to other available chiroptical methods of analysis are also presented.},

abstract = {Plasmonic dark modes are pure near-field modes that can arise from the plasmon hybridization in a set of interacting nanoparticles. When compared to bright modes, dark modes have longer lifetimes due to their lack of a net dipole moment, making them attractive for a number of applications. We demonstrate the excitation and optical detection of a collective dark plasmonic mode from individual plasmonic trimers. The trimers consist of triangular arrangements of gold nanorods, and due to this symmetry, the lowest?energy dark plasmonic mode can interact with radially polarized light. The experimental data presented confirm the excitation of this mode, and its assignment is supported with an electrostatic approximation wherein these dark modes are described in terms of plasmon hybridization. The strong confinement of energy in these modes and their associated near fields hold great promise for achieving strong coupling to single photon emitters.},

abstract = {Chiral plasmonic assemblies with strong and tunable chiroptical activity are emerging materials yet challenging to fabricate. Moreover, shell-programmed chiroptical regulation is really rare. Here, the chiroptical activity of core-shell (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) heterodimers (HDs) with different types and thicknesses of the shell but featuring the same gap was exploited. It was found that the type of shell guided the position of the chiral peaks, and the shell thickness tuned the intensity but also moderately affected the wavelength shift at invariable interparticle distance. Shell deposition intensified the hot-spot chirality, and evidently guided the enantiomorphous chiral configuration, resulting in a startlingly intense, asymmetric, dipolar coupling strength. The magnitude of the chiroptical activity showed an 8-10 fold enhancement with a maximum anisotropy factor (g-factor) of 1.5 x 10(-2) . Shell-driven chiroptical regulation opens new avenues to feasibly fabricate chiroptically active materials with desired chiroptical response for the development of switchable recognition units for sensitive and various target detections.},

Here we show that truly three-dimensional arrangements of plasmonic "meta-atoms" only exhibit a chiral optical response if similar plasmonic "atoms" are arranged in a handed fashion as we require resonant plasmonic coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that such particle groupings, similarly to molecular systems, possess the capability to encode their three-dimensional arrangement in unique and well-modulated spectra making them ideal candidates for a three-dimensional chiral plasmon ruler.

abstract = {In this work, the circular dichroisms (CD) of nanorice heterodimers consisting of two parallel arranged nanorices with the same size but different materials are investigated theoretically. Symmetry-breaking is introduced by using different materials and oblique incidence to achieve strong CD at the vicinity of Fano resonance peaks. We demonstrate that all Au-Ag heterodimers exhibit multipolar Fano resonances and strong CD effect. A simple quantitative analysis shows that the structure with larger Fano asymmetry factor has stronger CD. The intensity and peak positions of the CD effect can be flexibly tuned in a large range by changing particle size, shape, the inter-particle distance and surroundings. Furthermore, CD spectra exhibit high sensitivity to ambient medium in visible and near infrared regions. Our results here are beneficial for the design and application of high sensitive CD sensors and other related fields. ptical activity (OA), whose origin can be reduced to a different response of a system to right-and left-circularly polarized light, is a fantastic optical phenomenon discovered more than 100 years ago.

abstract = {Nanostructures with chiral geometries exhibit strong polarization rotation. However, achieving reversible modulation of chirality and polarization rotation in device-friendly solid-state films is diicult for rigid materials. Here, we describe nanocomposites, made by conformally coating twisted elastic substrates with films assembled layer-by-layer from plasmonic nanocolloids, whose nanoscale geometry and rotatory optical activity can be reversibly reconfigured and cyclically modulated by macroscale stretching, with up to tenfold concomitant increases in ellipticity. We show that the chiroptical activity at 660 nm of gold nanoparticle composites is associated with circular extinction from linear eeects. The polarization rotation at 550 nm originates from the chirality of nanoparticle chains with an S-like shape that exhibit a non-planar buckled geometry, with the handedness of the substrate's macroscale twist determining the handedness of the S-like chains. Chiroptical eeects at the nexus of mechanics, excitonics and plasmonics open new operational principles for optical and optoelectronic devices from nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and other nanoscale components. O ptically active chiral materials have been known since the time of Louis Pasteur and are predominantly based on chiral geometries of sp 3 -hybridized carbon atoms 1 . Chiral isomers typically found in organic chemistry generally exhibit modest chiroptical anisotropy, have limited spectral range, and are problematic to separate. The advent of nanoscale engineering has brought about the ability to create new types of chiral structures that can be made by design in pure forms of stereoisomers. Chiral metallic and semiconducting nanostructures have been shown to exhibit particularly strong optical activities in a wide region of the electromagnetic spectrum 2–4 . The origin of high chiroptical activity of nanoscale assemblies 2 is linked to high polarizability of nanoscale inorganic materials, leading to plasmonic and excitonic effects on the polarization rotation of incident photons 5 .

abstract = {A molecule or larger body is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image (enantiomer). Electromagnetic fields may be chiral, too, with circularly polarized light (CPL) as the paradigmatic example. A recently introduced measure of the local degree of chiral dissymmetry in electromagnetic fields suggested the existence of optical modes more selective than circularly polarized plane waves in preferentially exciting single enantiomers in certain regions of space. By probing induced fluorescence intensity, we demonstrated experimentally an 11-fold enhancement over CPL in discrimination of the enantiomers of a biperylene derivative by precisely sculpted electromagnetic fields. This result, which agrees to within 15{\%} with theoretical predictions, establishes that optical chirality is a fundamental and tunable property of light, with possible applications ranging from plasmonic sensors to absolute asymmetric synthesis.},

abstract = {The lack of mirror symmetry, chirality, plays a fundamental role in physics, chemistry and life sciences. The passive separation of entities that only differ by their handedness without need of a chiral material environment remains a challenging task with attractive scientific and industrial benefits. To date, only a few experimental attempts have been reported and remained limited down to the micron scale, most of them relying on hydrodynamical forces associated with the chiral shape of the micro-objects to be sorted. Here we experimentally demonstrate that material chirality can be passively sorted in a fluidic environment by chiral light owing to spin-dependent optical forces without chiral morphology prerequisite. This brings a new twist to the state-of-the-art optofluidic toolbox and the development of a novel kind of passive integrated optofluidic sorters able to deal with molecular scale entities is envisioned.},

abstract = {The interaction between individual plasmonic nanoparticles plays a crucial role in tuning and shaping the surface plasmon resonances of a composite structure. Here, we demonstrate that the detailed character of the coupling between plasmonic structures can be captured by a modified "circuit" model. This approach is generally applicable and, as an example here, is applied to a dolmen-like nanostructure consisting of a vertically placed gold monomer slab and two horizontally placed dimer slabs. By utilizing the full-wave eigenmode expansion method (EEM), we extract the eigenmodes and eigenvalues for these constituting elements and reduce their electromagnetic interaction to the structures' mode interactions. Using the reaction concept, we further summarize the mode interactions within a "coupling" matrix. When the driving voltage source imposed by the incident light is identified, an equivalent circuit model can be constructed. Within this model, hybridization of the plasmonic modes in the constituting nanostructure elements is discussed. The proposed circuit model allows the reuse of powerful circuit analysis techniques in the context of plasmonic structures. As an example, we derive an equivalent of Th{\'{e}}venin's theorem in circuit theory for nanostructures. Applying the equivalent Th{\'{e}}venin's theorem, the well-known Fano resonance is easily explained.},

These quasi-three-dimensional oligomers are interesting for applications because they exhibit ?hot? gaps and crevices of nanometric dimensions, a pronounced circular dichroism and optical chirality in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range, and they can be produced in large ensembles ({\textgreater}109) of identical orientation. We analyze the optical properties of the samples based on simulation results and find that the circular dichroism is due to strong near field coupling and intricate phase retardation effects originating in the three-dimensional character of the individual oligomers.},

abstract = {In the last 40 years the method of moments (MOM) has been a cornerstone in the field of computational electromagnetics. Traditionally, this method has been used to solve integral equations formulated for antennas and other components in the microwave frequency range and below. In this paper, the application of MOM in the field of plasmonics is briefly reviewed. First, existing literature is referenced. Then the differences with the classical implementations are pointed out. Finally, its applicability, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed. This is done by comparing it with a numerical finite difference time domain solver well-known in the plasmonics research community for a number of example structures. It is shown that also at these higher frequencies, namely in the IR and optical range, MOM is a very powerful technique. (Plasmonics::general)},

abstract = {Electromagnetic fields with complex spatial variation routinely arise in Nature. We study the response of a small molecule to monochromatic fields of arbitrary three-dimensional geometry. First, we consider the allowed configurations of the fields and field gradients at a single point in space. Many configurations cannot be generated from a single plane wave, regardless of polarization, but any allowed configuration can be generated by superposition of multiple plane waves. There is no local configuration of the fields and gradients that requires near-field effects. Second, we derive a set of local electromagnetic quantities, each of which couples to a particular multipole transition. These quantities are small or zero in plane waves, but can be large in regions of certain superpositions of plane waves. Our findings provide a systematic framework for designing far-field and near-field experiments to drive multipole transitions. The proposed experiments provide information on molecular structure that is inaccessible to other spectroscopic techniques and open the possibility for new types of optical control of molecules.},

@article{Wu2013a,
abstract = {Chiral assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) are typically constructed with helical or tetrahedral geometries. Simple pairs of NPs are not expected to display chirality due to basic symmetry considerations made under the assumption of their spherical geometry. In this study we demonstrate that assemblies consisting of two metallic NPs do possess chirality and strongly rotate polarization of light. Their chiroplasmonic properties are attributed to the prolate geometry of individual colloidal particles. When bridged by biomolecules, the NP pairs acquire scissor-like geometry, with the long axes of NPs forming an angle of {\~{}}9°. This small dihedral angle results in chirality of the NP pair, while the consistency of its sign due to the specific conformation of the bridging biomacromolecules breaks the enantiomeric equivalence of the NP pairs. Strong polarization rotation in these nanoassemblies makes possible their utilization in biological analysis. Heterodimers of gold and silver NPs were made using antibody-antigen bridges. Taking advantage of their chiroplasmonic properties, we investigated their bioanalitical potential for detection of an environmental toxin, microcystin-LR, and a cancer biomarker, prostate-specific antigen. The order-of-magnitude improvements in limits of detection compared to all other analytical techniques are attributed to plasmonic enhancement of intrinsic chirality of biological compounds, strong optical coupling of photons with NP assemblies with twisted geometries, and signal amplification due to the bisignate nature of circular dichroism bands.},

Here we propose and theoretically study all-dielectric metamaterials of a special class that represent a simple electromagnetic system supporting toroidal dipolar excitations in the THz part of the spectrum. We show that resonant transmission and reflection of such metamaterials is dominated by toroidal dipole scattering, the neglect of which would result in a misunderstanding interpretation of the metamaterials macroscopic response. Due to the unique field configuration of the toroidal mode the proposed metamaterials could serve as a platform for sensing, or enhancement of light absorption and optical nonlinearities.},

Asymmetric gold bowtie nanostructures were used as a model system with 2D chirality. The bowties functioned as a chiral nonlinear medium that converted the fundamental of a Ti:sapphire laser to its second harmonic frequency. The bowties consisted of two lithographically prepared equilateral triangles (base = 75 nm, height = 85 nm, thickness = 25 nm) separated by a 20 nm gap. Asymmetric bowties were formed by lateral displacement of one triangle by 10 nm, yielding C2 point group symmetry. The chirality of the bowtie nanostructures was confirmed via nonzero second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CDR) ratios, which came from single-particle SHG measurements.

Here, we propose a new paradigm for obtaining strong circular conversion dichroism (CCD) based on extrinsic 2D chirality in multilayer achiral MMs, showing that giant chiroptical response can be alternatively attained without complex structures. Our structure consists of an array of thin Au squares separated from a continuous Au film by a GaAs dielectric layer, where the Au squares occupy the sites of a rectangular lattice. This structure gives rise to a pronounced extrinsically 2D-chiral effect (CCD) in the mid-infrared (M-IR) region under an oblique incidence, where the 2D-chiral effect is due to the mutual orientation of the Au squares array and the incident light propagation direction; the large magnitude of CCD due to the large difference between left-to-left and right-to-right circularly polarized reflectance conversion efficiencies.},

We show that the nanoscrews will move through high-viscosity solutions with comparable velocities to that of larger micropropellers, even though they are so small that Brownian forces suppress their actuation in pure water. When actuated in viscoelastic hyaluronan gels, the nanopropellers appear to have a significant advantage, as they are of the same size range as the gel's mesh size. Whereas larger helices will show very low or negligible propulsion in hyaluronan solutions, the nanoscrews actually display significantly enhanced propulsion velocities that exceed the highest measured speeds in Newtonian fluids. The nanopropellers are not only promising for applications in the extracellular environment but small enough to be taken up by cells.},

abstract = {We report plasmon-mediated two-photon-photoluminescence (TPPL)-detected circular dichroism (CD) from colloidal metal nanoparticle assemblies. Two classes of solid gold nanosphere (SGN) dimers - heterodimers and homodimers - were examined using polarization-resolved TPPL, second harmonic generation (SHG), and one-photon photoluminescence (OPPL). Unambiguous CD was detected in both the TPPL and SHG signals, and the magnitudes of the CD responses in these measurements showed agreement for individual nanostructures. Heterodimers gave larger CD responses (average TPPL-CDR = 0.62±0.33; average SHG-CDR = 0.51±0.21) than homodimers (average TPPL-CDR = 0.19±0.04; average SHG-CDR = 0.18±0.06). OPPL-CD was not detected for either structure. Analysis of dimer emission properties suggested the CD responses were determined by properties of the one-photon-resonant mode excited by the laser. Average TPPL signals were (4.3±0.6)x larger than for SHG. Because signal amplitude is a primary determinant for spatial accuracies and precisions obtained from optical microscopy, CD contrast generated from plasmon-mediated TPPL, which we report for the first time, can extend the suite of super-resolution imaging techniques.},

abstract = {The vast majority of biologically active compounds, ranging from amino acids to essential nutrients such as glucose, possess intrinsic handedness. This in turn gives rise to chiral optical properties that provide a basis for detecting and quantifying enantio-specific concentrations of these molecules. However, traditional chiroptical spectroscopy and imaging techniques require cascading of multiple optical components in sophisticated setups. Here, we present a planar lens with an engineered dispersive response, which simulta- neously forms two images with opposite helicity of an object within the same field-of-view. In this way, chiroptical properties can be probed across the visible spectrum using only the lens and a camera without the addition of polarizers or dispersive optical devices. We map the circular dichroism of the exoskeleton of a chiral beetle, Chrysina gloriosa, which is known to exhibit high reflectivity of left-circularly polarized light, with high spatial resolution limited by the numerical aperture of the planar lens. Our results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces in realizing a compact and multifunctional device with unprecedented imaging capabilities.},

The modern interest was mainly inspired by the invention of scanning probe microscopy and by the first optical near-field measurements by DieterW. Pohl and co-workers at the IBM Research Laboratory in R¨ uschlikon, Switzerland, and also by parallel developments of other groups. Near-field optics received inspiration from the fields of surface enhanced spectroscopy and from studies of energy transfer. While optical near-fields were exten- sively exploited for overcoming the diffraction limit in optical imaging the study of their physical aspects revealed unique properties which cannot be imitated by free propagating radiation.},

abstract = {We review nonlinear optical processes that are specific to chiral molecules in solution and on surfaces. In contrast to conventional natural optical activity phenomena, which depend linearly on the electric field strength of the optical field, we discuss how optical processes that are nonlinear (quadratic, cubic, and quartic) functions of the electromagnetic field strength may probe optically active centers and chiral vibrations. We show that nonlinear techniques open entirely new ways of exploring chirality in chemical and biological systems: The cubic processes give rise to nonlinear circular dichroism and nonlinear optical rotation and make it possible to observe dynamic chiral processes at ultrafast time scales. The quadratic second-harmonic and sum-frequency-generation phenomena and the quartic processes may arise entirely in the electric-dipole approximation and do not require the use of circularly polarized light to detect chirality. They provide surface selectivity and their observables can be relatively much larger than in linear optical activity. These processes also give rise to the generation of light at a new color, and in liquids this frequency conversion only occurs if the solution is optically active. We survey recent chiral nonlinear optical experiments and give examples of their application to problems of biophysical interest.},

Recent developments of nonlinear light scattering techniques have resulted in a deeper insight of the underlying light-matter interactions. They have shed new light on the molecular mechanism of surface kinetics in solution, properties of interfacial water in contact with hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles and droplets, molecular orientation distribution of molecules at particle surfaces in solution, interfacial structure of surfactants at droplet interfaces, acid-base chemistry on particles in solution, and vesicle structure and transport properties.},

abstract = {To investigate interchromophore interactions in azobenzene polymers, we have undertaken a thorough spectroscopic analysis of the azodye [(S)-3-pivaloyloxy-1-(4'-nitro-4-azobenzene)pyrrolidine] by modeling the repeating unit of poly[(S)-3-methacryloyloxy-1-(4'-nitro-4-azobenzene)pyrrolidine) and its dimeric derivative whose synthesis is presented here. The analysis of the electronic and Raman spectra of the azodye in several solvents is based on a previously proposed model for polar chromophores in solution. Electronic and CD spectra of the dimeric unit are collected and analyzed within the framework of a new model. On the basis of the information collected from the spectroscopic analysis of the solvated dye, this model accounts for interchromophore interactions in the dimer. The large CD signal measured for the dimer (amounting to about a third of the signal measured for the polymer) suggests the presence of important chiral interactions in the dimeric unit, and is modeled in terms of a right-handed relative orientation of the two chromophores.},

abstract = {Chirality is a fundamental property and vital to chemistry, biology, physics and materials science. The ability to use asymmetry to operate molecular-level machines or macroscopically functional devices, or to give novel properties to materials, may address key challenges at the heart of the physical sciences. However, how chirality at one length scale can be translated to asymmetry at a different scale is largely not well understood. In this Review, we discuss systems where chiral information is translated across length scales and through space. A variety of synthetic systems involve the transmission of chiral information between the molecular-, meso- and macroscales. We show how fundamental stereochemical principles may be used to design and understand nanoscale chiral phenomena and highlight important recent advances relevant to nanotechnology. The survey reveals that while the study of stereochemistry on the nanoscale is a rich and dynamic area, our understanding of how to control and harness it and dial-up specific properties is still in its infancy. The long-term goal of controlling nanoscale chirality promises to be an exciting journey, revealing insight into biological mechanisms and providing new technologies based on dynamic physical properties.},

Therefore, a simple and robust method to retrieve the effective constitutive parameters for chiral metamaterials is urgently needed. Here, we analyze the wave propagation in chiral metamaterials and follow the regular retrieval procedure for ordinary metamaterials and apply it in chiral metamaterial slabs. Then based on the transfer matrix technique, the parameter retrieval is extended to treat samples with not only the substrate but also the top layers. After the parameter retrieval procedure, we take two examples to check our method and study how the substrate influences on the thin chiral metamaterials slabs. We find that the substrate may cause the homogeneous slab to be inhomogeneous, i.e. the reflections in forward and backward directions are different. However, the chiral metamaterial where the resonance element is embedded far away from the substrate is insensitive to the substrate.},

In this work, the molecular and surface structural origins of these large dichroic differences were explored in theoretical treatments and modeling calculations. Several new conclusions were formed regarding chirality in electric dipole allowed SHG measurements; (1) SHG-CD is allowed even in uniaxial films of achiral chromophores, provided they assemble with asymmetry in the twist angle, (2) for systems dominated by one or more chiral tensor element, this same asymmetry in surface packing is required for SHG-CD to be observed, and (3) large SHG-CD ratios are predicted in standard reflection and transmission measurements of ultrathin films in systems with spectral overlap between multiple excited states. The methodology described provides a formalism to aid in extracting structural information from nonlinear optical measurements of chiral films. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Here, for the first time, we developed assembly of nanoparticle (NP)-nanorod (NR) chiral heterodimers with chiral molecules to explore their chiroptical activities. The experimental results revealed that plasmonic CD responses were in the region from 520 to 750 nm, which was in agreement with the theoretical simulation. Importantly, the CD band could be regulated by controlling the gaps between adjacent NCs and altering the building blocks of the assemblies. These results show that the plasmonic chiroptical response of NP-NR heterodimers could come from the finger-crossed chiral construction of adjacent NC in the heterodimers and the formation of plasmonic hot-spots in the assemblies could further enhance the plasmonic CD. This work provides a new opportunity to create heterogeneous nanoscale plasmonic objects with tailorable chiroptical response for application in biosensors, in vivo chiral medical carriers and negative refractive index materials.},

The comparative examination of the following two correlation functionals, using the 6-31G* basis set, showed that the Coulomb attenuated method variant of the Becke's three-parameter exchange and the Lee-Yang-Parr (CAM-B3LYP) is more reliable than B3LYP in molecules such as S-BINAP, a heteroaromatic diphosphine chiral ligand with strong intramolecular charge transfer. To access the theoretical TPCD spectra, we employed time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the mentioned level of theory and over the first 40 electronic excited states including solvent effects by means of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The extended calculation on twice as many electronic excited states in vacuo proved to be crucial for the correct assignment of the experimental bands. TPA measurements were performed in the femtosecond regime and over a broad spectral range using the double L-scan technique.},

abstract = {In an assembly of double-layered metallic U-shaped resonators with two resonant frequencies omega(H) and omega(L), the effective induced electric and magnetic dipoles, which originate from the specific distribution of induced surface electric current upon the illumination of incident light, are collinear at the same frequency. Consequently, for left circularly polarized incident light, negative refractive index occurs at omega(H), whereas for right circularly polarized incident light it occurs at omega(L). We suggest that this design provides a new example to apply chiral structures to tune the electromagnetic properties, and could be enlightening in exploring chiral metamaterials.},

@article{Bai2007,
abstract = {A thorough theoretical study of the optical activity in planar chiral metamaterial (PCM) structures, made of both dielectric and metallic media, is conducted by the analysis of gammadion-shaped nanoparticle arrays. The general polarization properties are first analyzed from an effective-medium perspective, by analogy with natural optical activity, and then verified by rigorous numerical simulation, some of which are corroborated by previous experimental results. The numerical analysis suggests that giant polarization rotation (tens of degrees) may be achieved in the PCM structures with a thickness of only hundreds of nanometers. The artificial optical activity arises from circular birefringence induced by the structural chirality and is enhanced by the guided-mode or surface-plasmon resonances taking place in the structures. There are two polarization conversion types in the dielectric PCMs, whereas only one type in the metallic ones. Many intriguing features of the polarization property of PCMs are also revealed and explained: the polarization effect is reciprocal and vanishes in the symmetrically layered structures; the effect occurs only in the transmitted field, but not in the reflected field; and the polarization spectra of two enantiomeric PCM structures are mirror symmetric to each other. These remarkable properties pave the way for the PCMs to be used as polarization elements in new-generation integrated optical systems.},

In the low-frequency region, the multi-band resonances are mainly due to the cell itself; in the high-frequency region, they are mainly due to the interaction between adjacent cells. Compared with cut-wire pairs, U-shaped cells can realize resonances more easily at high frequencies and produce more negative-index transmission bands.},

Here we show that this prominent effect is now available in artificial electromagnetic systems, enabled by the advent of magnetoelastic metamaterials where a mechanical degree of freedom leads to a rich variety of strong nonlinear effects such as bistability and self-oscillations. We report spontaneous symmetry breaking in torsional chiral magnetoelastic structures where two or more meta-molecules with opposite handedness are electromagnetically coupled, modifying the system stability. Importantly, we show that chiral symmetry breaking can be found in the stationary response of the system, and the effect is successfully demonstrated in a microwave pump-probe experiment. Such symmetry breaking can lead to a giant nonlinear polarization change, energy localization and mode splitting, which provides a new possibility for creating an artificial phase transition in metamaterials, analogous to that in ferrimagnetic domains.},

abstract = {Based on the facts that chiral molecules response differently to left- and right-handed circular polarized light, chiroptical effects are widely employed for determining structure chirality, detecting enantiomeric excess, or controlling chemical reactions of molecules. Compared to those in natural materials, chiroptical behaviors can be significantly amplified in chiral plasmonic metamaterials due to the concentrated local fields in the structure. The on-going research towards giant chiroptical effects in metamaterial generally focus on optimizing the field-enhancement effects. However, the observed chiroptical effects in metamaterials rely on more complicated factors and various possibilities towards giant chiroptical effects remains unexplored. Here we study the optical-active second harmonic generation (SHG) behaviors in a pair of planar sawtooth gratings with mirror-imaged patterns. Significant multipolar effects were observed in the polarization-dependent SHG curves. We show that the chirality of the nanostructure not only give rise to nonzero chiral susceptibility tensor components within the electric-dipole approximation, but also lead to different levels of multipolar interactions for the two orthogonal circular polarizations that further enhance the nonlinear optical activity of the material. Our results thus indicate novel ways to optimize nonlinear plasmonic structures and achieve giant chiroptical response via multipolar interactions.},

abstract = {Metasurfaces, the 2D form of metamaterials with their ability in phase, amplitude and polarization manipulation are widely used in designing optical devices. Efforts to find proper photonic components in the terahertz (THz) range of frequency lead us to adopt metasurfaces as their constituent elements. Here, we conceived a broadband THz lens with an adjustable number and arrangement of focal points. To have a full control over the lens functionality, we used a metasurface with the capability of simultaneously modulating the amplitude and phase of the incident wave. C-shaped ring resonators (CSRRs) with different geometry and orientation capable of simultaneously manipulating phase and amplitude of the scattered fields, are proper choice to design the lens. We show that the introduced lens in a one-dimensional layout has a wide range of working frequencies within the THz spectrum, which can be used in a plethora of applications.},

To achieve this goal, a simultaneous control over complex spatial and localized structuring as well as material composition at the nanoscale is required.

The record chiro-optical effects obtained in the visible range are accompanied by an additional control over optical efficiency, even in the plasmonic context.

abstract = {The life is inherently chiral. Consequently, chirality plays a pivotal role in biochemistry and the evolution of life itself. Optical manifestation of chirality of biomolecules, so-called circular dichroism, is a remarkable but relatively weak effect appearing typically in the UV. In contrast to the biomolecules, plasmonic nanocrystals offer an interesting opportunity to create strong circular dichroism (CD) in the visible spectral range. Here we describe plasmonic properties of single chiral nanocrystals and focus on a new mechanism of optical chirality originating from a chiral shape of a nanocrystal. After careful examination, we found that this CD mechanism is induced by the mixing between different plasmon harmonics and is qualitatively different from the previously described dipolar CD effect in chiral assemblies of spherical nanoparticles. Chiral plasmonic nanocrystals studied here offer a new approach for the creation of nanomaterials with strong chiroptical responses in the visible spectral interval.},

A simple dipole model is utilized to explain this behavior theoretically. Illuminated with circularly polarized light, the chiral near-fields are still dominated by the distributions found for the linear polarization but show additional features due to the optical chirality of the incident light. Rotating the angle of linear polarization introduces more subtle changes to the distribution of optical chirality. Using our findings, we propose a novel scheme to obtain chiroptical far-field response using linearly polarized light, which could be utilized for applications such as optical enantiomer sensing.

The tapering also improves the extinction ratio. Depending on the side from which light impinges onto the tapered helices, the polarization conversions are different.

abstract = {An emerging application of multiphoton microscopy is the observation of unstained intact biological tissues based on intrinsic sources of nonlinear signals. However, reliable biomedical imaging requires a thorough analysis of these endogenous signals. Looking at skin biopsies, we focused on 2-Photon Excited Fluorescence (2PEF) arising from cytokeratins in the epidermis, and second harmonic generation (SHG) from collagen fibers in the dermis. We determined the 2PEF excitation spectrum and action cross section of purified keratins from human epidermis, and obtained a good agreement with insitu measurements. In order to analyze the role of chirality and collagen type in SHG signal, we performed polarization-resolved surface SHG experiments on thin films of collagens I and IV molecules. We observed that collagen I and IV molecules exhibit comparable SHG signals, except for the chiral contributions which are absent for collagen IV and represent typically 50{\%} of the signal for collagen I. We concluded that the large collagen I SHG efficiency is dominated by coherent effects due to the high density and quasi-crystalline order in collagen fibrils, whereas the lack of any alignment within the collagen IV molecules explains the absence of signal from this collagen type in SHG microscopy. {\textcopyright}2006 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

We present a general formalism to analyse such chiral effects and apply it to review known effects and to introduce new effects. The formalism is based on expanding the fundamental and second-harmonic fields in terms of their p- and s-polarized components. Each second-harmonic signal can then be described in terms of only three nonlinear coefficients, which are associated with the quadratic combinations of the fundamental-field components . The coefficients can be classired as achiral (allowed for all isotropic surfaces) or chiral (allowed only for chiral surfaces) independent of the details of the nonlinear light-matter interaction. The basic signatures of chirality are intensity-difference effects in which the efficiencies of second-harmonic generation are different for left- and right- hand circularly-polarized light or two orthogonal linear polarizations, for example. These effects depend on proper phase relations between the achiral and chiral coefficients. Measurements in which the state of polarization of the fundamental beam is continuously varied by a rotating quarter-wave plate are shown to be sensitive to chirality independent of any particular phase relation between the coefficients. Such measurements can also be used to determine uniquely the relative complex values of the coefficients and thus to characterize completely the nonlinear chiral response . The ability of the techniques to distinguish absolutely between the enantiomers of a chiral sample is possible only if interference between the electric-dipole and higher-multipole parts of the coefficients dominates the chiral response.},

We present an overview of the synthesis of these materials, along with some general design criteria for producing MOPs with high surface areas and micropore volumes. The advantages and disadvantages of MOPs with respect to inorganic materials such as zeolites and hybrid materials such as metal organic frameworks are discussed throughout, particularly in terms of practical applications such as catalysis, separations, and gas storage. We also discuss future opportunities in this area as well as the potential to unearth undiscovered MOPs among the large number of rigid backbone polymers and networks reported in the literature.},

This in turn could enable different approaches to generating energy from nuclear fusion. Relaxing the equilibrium requirement could widen the range of isotopes used in fusion fuels permitting cleaner and less hazardous reactions that do not produce high-energy neutrons. Here we propose and implement a means to drive fusion reactions between protons and boron-11 nuclei by colliding a laser-accelerated proton beam with a laser-generated boron plasma. We report proton-boron reaction rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those reported previously. Beyond fusion, our approach demonstrates a new means for exploring low-energy nuclear reactions such as those that occur in astrophysical plasmas and related environments.},

In the absence of intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force which pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small (as in some propagation invariant beams), attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds "pulling" as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.},

However, spectroscopic techniques have not been able to probe the structure of large biomolecules with similar levels of sensitivity. Here, we show that superchiral electromagnetic fields, generated by the optical excitation of plasmonic planar chiral metamaterials, are highly sensitive probes of chiral supramolecular structure. The differences in the effective refractive indices of chiral samples exposed to left- and right-handed superchiral fields are found to be up to 10(6) times greater than those observed in optical polarimetry measurements, thus allowing picogram quantities of adsorbed molecules to be characterized. The largest differences are observed for biomolecules that have chiral planar sheets, such as proteins with high $\beta$-sheet content, which suggests that this approach could form the basis for assaying technologies capable of detecting amyloid diseases and certain types of viruses.},

A key question relevant to the chiroptical response of such materials is the role of plasmon interactions as the constituent particles are brought closer, which is investigated in this paper through theoretical and experimental studies. The results of our theoretical analysis, when the particles are brought in close proximity are dramatic, showing a large red shift and enhancement of the spectral width and a near-exponential rise in the strength of the chiroptical response. These predictions were further confirmed with experimental studies of gold and silver nanoparticles arranged on a helical template, where the role of particle separation could be investigated in a systematic manner.

The ?optical chirality? of the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the nanoparticles was estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than what could be achieved in all other nanoplasmonic geometries considered so far, implying the suitability of the experimental system for sensitive detection of chiral molecules.},

abstract = {Microscopic techniques based on nonlinear optical processes provide alternative ways to visualize natural and artificial nanoscopic systems with minimum disturbance. In such techniques, each nonlinear process provides its own contrast mechanism and thus sensitivity to different sample properties. Powered by the mutual developments in instrumentation and theoretical descriptions, the capabilities of nonlinear microscopy have significantly increased in the past two decades. In addition, the vectorial focusing properties of conventional (for example, linear and circular) and unconventional (for example, radial and azimuthal) light polarizations are providing new capabilities for nonlinear microscopy, while simultaneously requiring new approaches in the interpretation of the acquired data. In this review article, we discuss the principles of nonlinear microscopy with vector fields and how its unique properties have recently been put to use in the imaging and characterization of various types of nanostructures.},

This is particularly challenging for complex structures at the nanoscale because surface-energy minimization generally causes small structures to be highly symmetric. Here we combine low-temperature shadow deposition with nanoscale patterning to realize nanocolloids with anisotropic three-dimensional shapes, feature sizes down to 20 nm and a wide choice of materials. We demonstrate the versatility of the fabrication scheme by growing three-dimensional hybrid nanostructures that contain several functional materials with the lowest possible symmetry, and by fabricating hundreds of billions of plasmonic nanohelices, which we use as chiral metafluids with record circular dichroism and tunable chiroptical properties.},

While arrays of gold helices have been suggested as compact circular polarizers, where a large difference of the diagonal elements of the Jones transmission matrix is desired, chiral metamaterials can also be designed to exhibit strong circular-polarization conversions. Here, a novel helical metamaterial design, exhibiting asymmetric, broadband circular-polarization conversion, is introduced. The metamaterial is composed of unit cells with a single helix that changes its handedness halfway along the helix axis. Based on numerical calculations, an intuitive model explaining the principle of operation is given. Furthermore, a novel fabrication approach employing STED-inspired direct laser writing in combination with electrochemical deposition of gold is presented. The experimental data show circular-polarization conversion of up to 75{\%} for an unmatched bandwidth of one octave, in very good agreement with theory.},

abstract = {We present a theory of second-harmonic generation from thin films of chiral materials. The formalism makes distinct the contributions of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions to the radiative process. Three susceptibility tensors form a minimal description of the optical nonlinearity, two for the nonlinear surface polarization and one for the nonlinear surface magnetization. The influence of optical interfaces is made explicit by using Fresnel coefficients to describe the reflection and transmission of the fundamental and second-harmonic radiation. Hence, the characterization and metrology of chiral materials by surface second-harmonic generation are given a firm theoretical foundation. In agreement with recent experimental observations, second-harmonic signals from chiral surfaces are predicted to depend sensitively upon whether the fundamental light is right- or left-hand circularly polarized. We show that this second-harmonic-generation circular-dichroism effect is a key signature of chirality and originates fundamentally from contributions of magnetic-dipole transitions to the nonlinear polarization and magnetization of the surface.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. The laser-induced intermolecular force that exists between two or more particles in the presence of an electromagnetic field is commonly termed "optical binding." Distinct from the single-particle forces that are at play in optical trapping at the molecular level, the phenomenon of optical binding is a manifestation of the coupling between optically induced dipole moments in neutral particles. In other, more widely known areas of optics, there are many examples of chiral discrimination - signifying the different response a chiral material has to the handedness of an optical input. In the present analysis, extending previous work on chiral discrimination in optical binding, a mechanism is identified using a quantum electrodynamical approach. It is shown that the optical binding force between a pair of chiral molecules can be significantly discriminatory in nature, depending upon both the handedness of the interacting particles and the polarization of the incident light, and it is typically several orders of magnitude larger than previously reported.},

abstract = {Matter structured on a length scale comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light can exhibit unusual optical properties. Particularly promising components for such materials are metal nanostructures, where structural alterations provide a straightforward means of tailoring their surface plasmon resonances and hence their interaction with light. But the top-down fabrication of plasmonic materials with controlled optical responses in the visible spectral range remains challenging, because lithographic methods are limited in resolution and in their ability to generate genuinely three-dimensional architectures. Molecular self-assembly provides an alternative bottom-up fabrication route not restricted by these limitations, and DNA- and peptide-directed assembly have proved to be viable methods for the controlled arrangement of metal nanoparticles in complex and also chiral geometries. Here we show that DNA origami enables the high-yield production of plasmonic structures that contain nanoparticles arranged in nanometre-scale helices. We find, in agreement with theoretical predictions, that the structures in solution exhibit defined circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion effects at visible wavelengths that originate from the collective plasmon-plasmon interactions of the nanoparticles positioned with an accuracy better than two nanometres. Circular dichroism effects in the visible part of the spectrum have been achieved by exploiting the chiral morphology of organic molecules and the plasmonic properties of nanoparticles, or even without precise control over the spatial configuration of the nanoparticles. In contrast, the optical response of our nanoparticle assemblies is rationally designed and tunable in handedness, colour and intensity-in accordance with our theoretical model.},

We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that these nanoparticles have strong magnetic dipole resonance, which can be continuously tuned throughout the whole visible spectrum varying particle size and visually observed by means of dark-field optical microscopy.

However, complex systems, such as large molecules and nanoparticles, lack the simple internal resonances required for laser cooling. Here we report on a hybrid scheme that uses the external resonance of an optical cavity, combined with radio frequency (RF) fields, to trap and cool a single charged nanoparticle. An RF Paul trap allows confinement in vacuum, avoiding instabilities that arise from optical fields alone, and crucially actively participates in the cooling process. This system offers great promise for cooling and trapping a wide range of complex charged particles with applications in precision force sensing, mass spectrometry, exploration of quantum mechanics at large mass scales and the possibility of creating large quantum superpositions.},

A sharp, non-radiative Fano resonance supported by the plasmonic metamaterial exhibits strongly enhanced near-field, and the resonance frequency is tailored to match the vibrational fingerprint of the target molecule. By utilizing the near-field nature of the plasmonic excitation, significantly enhanced absorption signal of molecules in the infrared spectroscopy are obtained, enabling ultrasensitive detection of only minute quantities of organic molecules. The enhancement of molecular absorption up to 10(5) fold is obtained, and sensitive detection of molecules at zeptomole levels (corresponding to a few tens of molecules within a unit cell) is achieved with high signal-to-noise ratio in our experiment.

This technique was successfully applied to the accurate determination of two-photon absorption (2PA) circular dichroism and 2PA circular-linear dichroism in a chiral solution. To our knowledge, this is the first time these nonlinear optical effects have been accurately measured. Our technique is expected to lead efforts in the study of biological systems and in the design of metamaterials with a negative refractive index.},

abstract = {We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix simulations on finite lengths of electromagnetic metamaterials, to determine the effective permittivity ͑␧͒ and permeability ͑␮͒. We perform this analysis on structures composed of periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators ͑SRRs͒, and both wires and SRRs. We find the recovered frequency-dependent ␧ and ␮ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of ␧ is negative, and SRRs produce a frequency region in which the real part of ␮ is negative. In the combination structure, at frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ␧ and ␮ are simultaneously negative, the real part of the index of refraction is also found to be unambiguously negative. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.65.195104 PACS number͑s͒: 41.20.Jb, 42.25.Bs, 73.20.Mf It has been proposed that electromagnetic metamaterials—composite structured materials, formed ei-ther from periodic or random arrays of scattering elements— should respond to electromagnetic radiation as continuous materials, at least in the long wavelength limit. 1,2 In recent experiments and simulations, 3,4 it has been demonstrated that certain metamaterial configurations exhibit scattering behav-ior consistent with the assumption of approximate frequency-dependent forms for ␧ and ␮. However, the techniques ap-plied in those studies probed the materials indirectly, and did not provide an explicit measurement that would assign val-ues for ␧ and ␮. In this Rapid Communication, we aim to show that the previous conjectures were indeed valid: unam-biguous values for ␧ and ␮ can be applied to electromagnetic metamaterials. Our approach here utilizes the transmission and reflection coefficients ͑S parameters, equivalently͒ calcu-lated for a wave normally incident on a finite slab of metamaterial. We invert the scattering data to determine re-fractive index n and impedance z, for systems of several thicknesses, from which we obtain self-consistent values for ␧ and ␮. While we utilize simulation data in this study, the technique we describe will be readily applicable to the ex-perimental characterization of metamaterial samples when-ever the scattering parameters are known. The common method of characterizing the electromag-netic scattering properties of a homogeneous material is to identify its z and n. 5,6 While it is possible to completely specify the scattering in terms of z and n, it is often more convenient to choose a second set of analytic variables that carry a direct material interpretation. These variables are the electric permittivity ␧ϭn/z, and the magnetic permeability ␮ϭnz. Both n and z, and therefore ␧ and ␮, are frequency-dependent complex functions that satisfy certain require-ments based on causality. For passive materials, Re(z) and Im(n) must be greater than zero.},

Transfer of chirality from biomolecules to the plasmonic resonances is a collective phenomenon and strongly depends on the geometry of nanostructure. Collective effects in a molecular chiral shell may suppress or enhance plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) depending on the geometry of hybrid nanocrystal. In large chiral plasmonic structures, we identify a new electrodynamic mechanism of plasmonic CD that is qualitatively different to the near-field, dipolar mechanism of the plasmonic chirality described by us previously. Our models also show that anisotropic nanocrystals, such as nanorods or oriented molecular shells, have strongly enhanced CD at the plasmonic frequency. A family of chiral plasmonic nanostructures proposed and modeled here can be used for designing new optical media and chiral sensors.},

abstract = {The manipulation of the chirality and corresponding optical activity in the visible-near-infrared (NIR) light region is significant to realize applications in the fields of chemical sensing, enantioselective separation, chiral nanocatalysis, and optical devices. We studied the plasmon-induced circular dichroism (CD) response by one-dimensional (1D) assembly of cysteine (CYS) and gold nanorods (GNRs). Typically, GNRs can form end-to-end assembly through the electrostatic attraction of CYS molecules preferentially attached on the ends of different GNRs. CD responses are observed at both the UV and visible-NIR light region in the 1D assembly, which are assigned to the CYS molecules and the GNRs, respectively. In addition, the wavelength of the CD responses can be manipulated from 550 nm to more than 900 nm through altering the aspect ratios of GNRs in 1D assembly. Anisotropic enhancement of optical activity is discovered, suggesting that the enhancement of the longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of GNRs in the CD response is much more apparent than that of the transverse LSPR. The CD responses of individual CYS-attached GNRs and CYS-assembled gold nanoparticles (GNPs) substantiate that the form of assembly and the shape of building blocks are significant not only for the intensity but for the line shape of the CD signals.},

Both single and triple-nanowire geometries have been studied. In particular, we found that in single-helical nanostructures, the enhancement of chiro-optical effects achievable by geometrical design is limited, especially with respect to the operation wavelength and the circular polarization conversion purity. Conversely, in the triple-helical nanowire configuration, the dominant interaction is the coupling among the intertwined coaxial helices which is driven by a symmetric spatial arrangement. Consequently, a general improvement in the g-factor, extinction ratio and signal-to-noise-ratio is achieved in a broad spectral range. Moreover, while in single-helical nanowires a mixed linear and circular birefringence results in an optical activity strongly dependent on the sample orientation and wavelength, in the triple-helical nanowire configuration, the obtained purely circular birefringence leads to a large optical activity up to 8°, independent of the sample angle, and extending in a broad band of 500 nm in the visible range. These results demonstrate a strong correlation between the configurational internal interactions and the chiral feature designation, which can be effectively exploited for nanoscale chiral device engineering.},

It is commonly assumed that light should move a particle forward and indeed an incident plane wave with a photon momentum ħk can only push any particle, independent of its properties, in the direction of k. Here we demonstrate, using full-wave simulations, that an anomalous lateral force can be induced in a direction perpendicular to that of the incident photon momentum if a chiral particle is placed above a substrate that does not break any left-right symmetry. Analytical theory shows that the lateral force emerges from the coupling between structural chirality (the handedness of the chiral particle) and the light reflected from the substrate surface. Such coupling induces a sideway force that pushes chiral particles with opposite handedness in opposite directions.},

Recent realization of knotted nematic disclinations stabilized by colloidal particles raised a challenge of free-standing knots. Here we demonstrate the creation of free-standing knotted and linked disclination loops in the cholesteric ordering fields, which are confined to spherical droplets with homeotropic surface anchoring. Our approach, using free energy minimization and topological theory, leads to the stabilization of knots via the interplay of the geometric frustration and intrinsic chirality. Selected configurations of the lowest complexity are characterized by knot or link types, disclination lengths and self-linking numbers. When cholesteric pitch becomes short on the confinement scale, the knotted structures change to practically unperturbed cholesteric structures with disclinations expelled close to the surface. The drops with knots could be controlled by optical beams and may be used for photonic elements.},

abstract = {We experimentally investigated remotely excited Raman optical activity (ROA) using propagating surface plasmons in chiral Ag nanowires. Using chiral fmoc-glycyl-glycine-OH (FGGO) molecules, we first studied the local surface plasmon-enhanced ROA. We found that the Raman intensity can be excited by left- and right-circularly polarized lights and that the circular intensity difference (CID) can be significantly enhanced. Second, by selecting vibrational modes with large Raman and ROA intensities that are not influenced by chemical enhancements, we studied remotely excited ROA imaging and the CID of FGGO molecules by propagating a plasmonic waveguide using Ag chiral nanostructures. When laser light was radiated on one of the Ag terminals, the measured CID of the FGG at the other terminal showed little change compared to the local excited CID. Meanwhile, when the laser light was radiated on the Ag nanowires (not on the terminals) and was coupled to the nearby nanoantenna, the CID of the ROA could be manipulated by altering the coupling angle between the Ag nanowires. To directly demonstrate the propagation of ROA along the nanowire and its remote detection, we also measured the remotely excited ROA spectra. Our experimental method has the potential to remotely determine the chirality of molecular structures and the absolute configuration or conformation of a chiral live cell.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods can be internalized by macrophages (an important early cellular marker in atherosclerosis and cancer) and used as an imaging contrast agent for macrophage targeting. Objective of this study is to compare two-photon luminescence (TPL) properties of four aspect ratios of gold nanorods with surface plasmon resonance at 700, 756, 844 and 1060 nm respectively. TPL from single nanorods and Rhodamine 6G particles was measured using a laser-scanning TPL microscope. Nanorod TPL emission spectrum was recorded by a spectrometer. Quadratic dependence of luminescence intensity on excitation power (confirming a TPL process) was observed below a threshold (e.g., {\textless}1.6 mW), followed by photobleaching at higher power levels. Dependence of nanorod TPL intensity on excitation wavelength indicated that the two-photon action cross section (TPACS) is plasmon-enhanced. Largest TPACS of a single nanorod (12271 GM) was substantially larger than a single Rhodamine 6G particle (25 GM) at 760 nm excitation. Characteristics of nanorod TPL emission spectrum can be explained by plasmon-enhanced interband transition of gold. Comparison results of TPL brightness, TPACS and emission spectrum of nanorods can guide selection of optimal contrast agent for selected imaging applications.},

@article{Rothemund2006a,
abstract = {'Bottom-up fabrication', which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

The dimers are prepared using exclusively achiral reagents, and the resulting dimer solution produces no detectable ensemble circular dichroism response. However, single-particle circular differential scattering measurements uncover that this dimer sample is a racemic mixture of individual nanostructures with significant positive and negative chiroptical signals.

abstract = {Herein, we report a new wet-synthesis method to separate some water-soluble chiral silver nanoclusters with high yield. The cluster material was obtained by the reduction of silver nitrate with NaBH4 in the presence of three ligands l-penicillamine (l-pen), d-penicillamine (d-pen) and racemic mixture of penicillamine (rac-pen), functioning as capping ligand. For characterizing all silver cluster samples, the particle size was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and their average chemical formula was determined from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis (EA). The particles sizes of all three clusters are 2.1 ± 0.2 nm. The optical properties of the samples were studied by four different methods: UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The spectra are dominated by the typical and intense plasmon peak at 486 nm accompanied by a small shoulder at 540 nm. Infrared spectroscopy was measured for the free ligand and protected silver nanoclusters, where the disappearance of the S-H vibrational band (2535–2570 cm−1) in the silver nanoclusters confirmed anchoring of ligand to the cluster surface through the sulfur atom. PL studies yielded the fluorescent properties of the samples. The main focus of this work, however, lies in the chirality of the particles. For all silver clusters CD spectra were recorded. While for clusters capped with one of the two enantiomers (D- or L-form) typical CD spectra were observed, no significant signals were detected for a racemic ligand mixture. Furthermore, silver clusters show quite large asymmetry factors (up to 3 × 10−4) in comparison to most other ligand protected clusters. These large factors and bands in the visible range of the spectrum suggest a strong chiral induction from the ligand to the metal core. Textural features of the prepared silver nanoclusters were investigated using nitrogen adsorption-desorption at −196 °C. Specific surface area SBET, pore volume and average pore diameter were calculated.},

@article{Choi2012,
abstract = {Recently, Tang and Cohen [Y. Tang and A. E. Cohen, Science 332, 333 (2011)] proposed and demonstrated the use of “superchiral” electromagnetic fields to enhance optical enantioselectivity. Their work generated much excitement as enantioselective signals are typically quite small, and it appeared that the enhancement factor could be extremely large. In this paper we explicitly show the limitations of such fields by including the magnetic susceptibility term. This term is small and is ignored in most cases compared to the electric polarizability term. However, for the fields used, the enhancement was obtained at the electric field energy node. Due to conservation of field energy, the magnetic field energy is then maximum, and the magnetic susceptibility contribution can no longer be ignored. This then is what limits the enhancement of the optical enantioselectivity. For a counterpropagating left- and right-circularly polarized light field, as used in the aforementioned experiment, we show that this fundamentally limits the enhancement to one or two orders of magnitude in general, determined by the ratio of the magnetic susceptibility to the electric polarizability of the material used. We also generalize the dissymmetry factor to include optical rotation effects present in chiral media, as opposed to fields being in vacuum. In the process, we generalize Lipkin's “Z000{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi {\_}moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}Z{\textless}mn{\textgreater}000 zilch” (or “optical chirality”) to that for a linear medium. This generalization shows that chirality of the material cannot be completely separated from chirality of the field and that opposite enantiomers are symmetric in terms of the dissymmetry factor enhancement. Finally, an analogy between ellipsometric chiroptical signal enhancement and enhanced optical enantioselectivity using a standing wave chiral field is discussed. Our analysis and generalization can be used as a guide for future searches of locally enhanced chiral fields.},

Previous routes use electron-beam lithography or direct laser writing but widespread application is restricted by their expense and low throughput. Scalable approaches including soft lithography, colloidal self-assembly, and interference holography, produce structures limited in feature size, material durability, or geometry. By multiply stacking gold nanowire flexible gratings, we demonstrate a scalable high-fidelity approach for fabricating flexible metallic woodpile photonic crystals, with features down to 10 nm produced in bulk and at low cost. Control of stacking sequence, asymmetry, and orientation elicits great control, with visible-wavelength band-gap reflections exceeding 60{\%}, and with strong induced chirality. Such flexible and stretchable architectures can produce metamaterials with refractive index near zero, and are easily tuned across the IR and visible ranges.},

It is typically built from a linearly birefringent crystal such as calcite, which has different critical reflection angles for s- and p-polarized light, leading to the transmission of one linear polarization and angled reflection to the other. However, the analogue for splitting circularly polarized light has yet to be demonstrated due to a lack of natural materials with sufficient circular birefringence. Here, we present a nano-engineered photonic-crystal chiral beam-splitter that fulfils this task. It consists of a prism featuring a nanoscale chiral gyroid network and can separate left- and right-handed circularly polarized light in the wavelength region around 1.615 um. The structure is fabricated using a galvo-dithered direct laser writing method and could become a useful component for developing integrated photonic circuits that provide a new form of polarization control.},

In a right-angle trimer system, the local field intensity excited by right-hand circularly polarized light is almost one thousand times larger than the left-hand case. By analyzing the polarization and phase of the local field in plasmonic hotspots, we found this local circular dichroism is originated from the near-field interference excited by orthogonal polarized incident lights. The local circular dichroism can be tuned by the rotation of the third particle, the interparticle distance, and the dielectric environment. This phenomenon could also widely exist in more complicated nanoaggregates. These findings would benefit for resolving light handedness, and enhancing circular dichroism and optical activity.},

abstract = {We report on the enhanced optical properties of chiral magnetic nanohelices with critical dimensions comparable to the ferromagnetic domain size. They are shown to be ferromagnetic at room temperature, have defined chirality, and exhibit large optical activity in the visible as verified by electron microscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, natural circular dichroism (NCD), and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements. The structures exhibit magneto-chiral dichroism (MChD), which directly demonstrates coupling between their structural chirality and magnetism. A chiral nickel (Ni) film consisting of an array of nanohelices ?100 nm in length exhibits an MChD anisotropy factor gMChD ≈ 10?4 T?1 at room temperature in a saturation field of ?0.2 T, permitting polarization-independent control of the film?s absorption properties through magnetic field modulation. This is also the first report of MChD in a material with structural chirality on the order of the wavelength of light, and therefore the Ni nanohelix array is a metamaterial with magnetochiral properties that can be tailored through a dynamic deposition process.},

abstract = {Many naturally occurring biomolecules, such as amino acids, sugars and nucleotides, are inherently chiral. Enantiomers, a pair of chiral isomers with opposite handedness, often exhibit similar physical and chemical properties due to their identical functional groups and composition, yet show different toxicity to cells. Detecting enantiomers in small quantities has an essential role in drug development to eliminate their unwanted side effects. Here we exploit strong chiral interactions with plasmonic metamaterials with specifically designed optical response to sense chiral molecules down to zeptomole levels, several orders of magnitude smaller than what is typically detectable with conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. In particular, the measured spectra reveal opposite signs in the spectral regime directly associated with different chiral responses, providing a way to univocally assess molecular chirality. Our work introduces an ultrathin, planarized nanophotonic interface to sense chiral molecules with inherently weak circular dichroism at visible and near-infrared frequencies.},

abstract = {Quantum teleportation is an important ingredient in distributed quantum networks, and can also serve as an elementary operation in quantum computers. Teleportation was first demonstrated as a transfer of a quantum state of light onto another light beam; later developments used optical relays and demonstrated entanglement swapping for continuous variables. The teleportation of a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now also been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a different nature--light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and 'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10 caesium atoms). Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean photon number (n) up to a few hundred. The fidelities are 0.58 +/- 0.02 for n = 20 and 0.60 +/- 0.02 for n = 5--higher than any classical state transfer can possibly achieve. Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a quantum repeater. An important factor for the implementation of quantum networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this is 0.5 metres in the present experiment. As our experiment uses propagating light to achieve the entanglement of light and atoms required for teleportation, the present approach should be scalable to longer distances.},

These rationally constructed Br{\o}nsted acids possess an extremely sterically demanding chiral microenvironment, with a single catalytically relevant and geometrically constrained bifunctional active site.

A nonzero difference in either case indicates chirality, where no difference should be measured for an isotropic achiral surface. We examine the complementariness of these two techniques theoretically and experimentally. In experiments utilizing thin films of a chiral poly(isocyanide), we measure the second‐harmonic response as a function of the state of polarization of the fundamental light when manipulated by both quarter and half waveplates. We extract the circular and linear differences from these more complete measurements and find the largest circular and linear differences to be 23{\%} and 118{\%}, respectively.},

The SHG circular-dichroism (CD) effect is much larger than in ordinary CD spectroscopy because SHG-CD is electric dipole allowed. The technique allows the study of chiral surfaces. The preference for left or right circularly polarized light is dependent on both the chirality (R or S) and the absolute orientation of the molecules (pointed up or down). (chiral)},

Here we demonstrate efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in a serrated nanogap plasmonic geometry that generates steep electric field gradients within a dielectric material. We utilize an ultrafast optical pump to control plasmonically induced electric-fields and to generate bandwidth-limited second-harmonic pulses.

The assembly is controlled by varying the density of the primer on the surface of gold NPs and the number of PCR cycles generating a mixture of dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., with gradually increasing complexity. This process leads to strong chirality of the assemblies arising from the three-dimensional positioning of NPs in space which had never been observed before. A circular dichroism band of the superstructures coincides with the plasmon oscillations of the multi-NP systems of Au colloids. This new collective optical property of NPs embracing the diversity of shapes and diameters in the starting dispersions opens unique opportunities for the development of negative index materials.},

We will then highlight the transfer of asymmetry from chiral photons to racemic amino acids and elucidate current experimental data on the photochemical synthesis of amino and diamino acid structures in simulated interstellar and circumstellar ice environments. The chirality inherent within actual interstellar (cometary) ice environments will be considered in this discussion: in 2014 the Rosetta Lander Philae onboard the Rosetta space probe is planned to detach from the orbiter and soft-land on the surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It is equipped for the in situ enantioselective analysis of chiral prebiotic organic species in cometary ices. The scientific design of this mission will therefore be presented in the context of analysing the formation of amino acid structures within interstellar ice analogues as a means towards furthering understanding of the origin of asymmetric biological molecules.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of our recent studies of the magnetization-induced nonlinear optical effects in magnetic nanoparticles are surveyed. There are three aspects of nonlinear magneto-optics of nanoparticles, which attract attention in this review being interdisciplinary in terms of magnetism, low-dimensionality, nonlinear and coherent optics. The first is the fact that the nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect (NOMOKE), i.e. magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG), exists in magnetic nanogranular films simultaneously with giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR). Moreover, the NOMOKE contrast attains maximum at the same content of magnetic component in magnetic nanogranular films as the maximum of GMR coefficient. Up to now nonlinear magneto-optics was concentrated on the regular magnetic systems and as a consequence described a coherent nonlinear response. On the contrary, in recent studies an attention is turned to the random magnetic nanostructures and, in particular, to the random two-dimensional arrays of magnetic nanoparticles fabricated by Self-Assembly techniques. Thus, an incoherent analog of MSHG, which can be called: magnetization-induced hyper-Rayleigh scattering, is observed. And finally a general issue of intrinsic weakness of magnetization-induced nonlinear optical effects governed by the fine structure parameter is discussed in terms of internal homodyne effect as one of the mechanisms of an enhancement of the magnetic effects in nonlinear optics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Plasmonic nanoparticles made of gold and silver have attracted a great deal of research attention in various fields, such as biosensors, imaging, therapy, nanophotonics, catalysis and light harvesting due to their unique optical and electronic properties. Plasmonic nanoparticle colloids may exhibit strong colours in the visible region due to localized surface plasmon resonances, whereas their aggregates exhibit different linear and nonlinear optical properties. Therefore, a smart design of chemical interactions between analytes and the nanoparticles surface may lead to gradual optical changes, which can be probed by various sensing methods, allowing quantitative analyte detection. A significant amount of research has been carried out toward the development of plasmonic sensors based on analyte-induced aggregation of Au or Ag nanoparticles, and the sensitivity and selectivity of such plasmonic biosensors have been greatly improved over the years. In this feature article, we summarize different design strategies that have been employed to induce the aggregation of plasmonic nanoparticles upon the addition of various analytes such as DNA, proteins, organic molecules and inorganic ions. We introduce various optical assays, such as colorimetry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, two-photon photoluminescence, dynamic light scattering, hyper-Rayleigh scattering and chiroptical activity. From the discussion, it can be concluded that plasmonic sensors based on nanoparticle aggregation offer simple, highly sensitive and selective detection of various analytes. Finally, we discuss some of the future directions of plasmonic nanosensors toward device integration for practical applications.},

These nanostructures are fabricated via an approach based on direct laser writing into a positive-tone photoresist followed by electrochemical deposition of gold. For propagation of light along the helix axis, the structure blocks the circular polarization with the same handedness as the helices, whereas it transmits the other, for a frequency range exceeding one octave. The structure is scalable to other frequency ranges and can be used as a compact broadband circular polarizer.},

Incorporating zeroth- and first-order multipole expansion terms, it is applied to bridged triarylamine helicene molecules to examine the experimental results of single-molecule chiroptical spectroscopy. The ground- and excited-state wave functions and a series of transition moments required for the evaluation of the anisotropic g value are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The probability histograms obtained for simulated g values, uniformly sampled in regard to the direction of light propagation toward the fixed molecule, show that even for a given diastereomer, the dissymmetry factors have positive and negative values and can deviate from their averages to a considerable extent when the angle between the electric dipole transition moment and the propagation vector of the incident light is near 0 or 180°.},

Reciprocal objects attain the upper bound if and only if they are transparent for all the fields of one polarization handedness (helicity). Additionally, electromagnetic duality symmetry, i.e., helicity preservation upon interaction, turns out to be a necessary condition for reciprocal objects to attain the upper bound. We use these results to provide requirements for the design of such extremal objects. The requirements can be formulated as constraints on the polarizability tensors for dipolar objects or on the material constitutive relations for continuous media. We also outline two applications for objects of maximum electromagnetic chirality: a twofold resonantly enhanced and background-free circular dichroism measurement setup, and angle-independent helicity filtering glasses. Finally, we use the theoretically obtained requirements to guide the design of a specific structure, which we then analyze numerically and discuss its performance with respect to maximal electromagnetic chirality.},

The helicity of optical vortices is transferred to the constituent elements of the irradiated material (mostly melted material), resulting in the formation of chiral metal nanoneedles. The chirality of these nanoneedles could be controlled by just changing the sign of the helicity of the optical vortex. The tip curvature of these chiral nanoneedles was measured to be {\textless}40 nm, which is less than 1/25th of the laser wavelength (1064 nm). Such chiral metal nanoneedles will enable us to selectively distinguish the chirality and optical activity of molecules and chemical composites on a nanoscale and they will provide chiral selectivity for nanoscale imaging systems (e.g., atomic force microscopes), chemical reactions on plasmonic nanostructures, and planar metamaterials.},

The research agenda is now shifting towards achieving tunable, switchable, nonlinear and sensing functionalities. It is therefore timely to discuss the emerging field of metadevices where we define the devices as having unique and useful functionalities that are realized by structuring of functional matter on the subwavelength scale. In this Review we summarize research on photonic, terahertz and microwave electromagnetic metamaterials and metadevices with functionalities attained through the exploitation of phase-change media, semiconductors, graphene, carbon nanotubes and liquid crystals. The Review also encompasses microelectromechanical metadevices, metadevices engaging the nonlinear and quantum response of superconductors, electrostatic and optomechanical forces and nonlinear metadevices incorporating lumped nonlinear components.},

abstract = {Chirality of plasmonic films can be strongly enhanced by three-dimensional (3D) out-of-plane geometries. The complexity of lithographic methods currently used to produce such structures and other methods utilizing chiral templates impose limitations on spectral windows of chiroptical effects, the size of substrates, and hence, further research on chiral plasmonics. Here we demonstrate 3D chiral plasmonic nanostructures (CPNs) with high optical activity in the visible spectral range based on initially achiral nanopillars from ZnO. We made asymmetric gold nanoshells on the nanopillars by vacuum evaporation at different inclination and rotation angles to achieve controlled symmetry breaking and obtained both left- and right-rotating isomers. The attribution of chiral optical effects to monolithic enantiomers made in this process was confirmed by theoretical calculations based on their geometry established from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The chirality of the nanoshells is retained upon the release from the substrate into a stable dispersion. Deviation of the incident angle of light from normal results in increase of polarization rotation and chiral g-factor as high as -0.3. This general approach for preparation of abiological nanoscale chiral materials can be extended to other out-of plane 3D nanostructures. The large area films made on achiral nanopillars are convenient for sensors, optical devices, and catalysis.},

The polarization of the surfaceSHG radiation is rotated with respect to that of the input fundamental radiation in a direction indicative of the chirality of the surface molecules. The origin of SHG‐ORD lies in the electric dipole‐allowed $\chi$(2)tensor elements, one of which is associated with the handedness of surface species. The SHG‐ORD rotation is independent of the density of surface species for an optically pure system, but is dependent on the chiral excess for mixtures of enantiomers. It is wavelength dependent but resonance is not required to observe the rotation. The experiments show that while SHG‐ORD has origins quite distinct from ordinary ORD, it can be utilized to measure chiralstructures of surfaces.},

Here, we show that a suitable switching material can be engineered by harnessing the nanoscale confinement of light and the nonlinearity of metal. Using a nanostructured gold film, we demonstrate resonant switching, the performance of which is at least one order of magnitude faster and stronger than designed materials reported so far.

A large tunability range of the circular dichroism response from ? = 4.15 to 4.90 ?m is achieved, and we experimentally demonstrate that the combination of a passive bias-type chiral layer with the active chiral metamaterial allows for switchable chirality, that is, the reversal of the circular dichroism sign, in a fully planar, layered design without the need for geometrical reconfiguration. Because phase change materials can be electrically and optically switched, our designs may open up a path for highly integrated mid-IR polarization engineering devices that can be modulated on ultrafast time scales.\nActive control over the handedness of a chiral metamaterial has the potential to serve as key element for highly integrated polarization engineering approaches, polarization sensitive imaging devices, and stereo display technologies.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Whereas a is identical for the mirror-image forms or enantiomers of the molecule, b has opposite signs; the associated contribution to F therefore pointing in opposite directions. A simple optical field is presented for which vanishes but does not, so that F is absolutely discriminatory.

Instead, the second-harmonic intensities are recorded at a number of selected distinct azimuthal orientations of the sample. The signals are recorded as functions of the state of polarization of the fundamental laser beam. Only normalized polarization line shapes are required. As the line shapes need not be mutually calibrated, the technique is limited only by the accuracy of the individual polarization measurements and is applicable also to samples with inhomogeneous surface coverage of molecules. The technique is applied to anisotropic chiral thin films with C2C2 symmetry made of helicenebisquinone. Full analysis of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of the samples is performed and the effects of anisotropy and chirality separated. The part of the nonlinearity arising from chirality is shown to dominate the nonlinear response.},

The form of the spin-motion coupling ensures that the scheme works for thermal states so that moderate feedback cooling suffices. No separate control or observation of the c.m. state is required and thereby one dispenses with cavities, spatially resolved detection, and low-mass-dispersion ensembles. The controllable relative phase in the Ramsey interferometry stems from a gravitational potential difference so that it uniquely evidences coherence between states which involve the whole nanocrystal being in spatially distinct locations.},

These nonlinear effects have long been used for chiral molecular analysis and characterization, however both linear and nonlinear optical rotation can occur even in achiral structures, if the structure is birefringent due to anisotropy. Crucially, chiroptical effects resulting from anisotropy typically exhibit a strong dependence on structural orientation.

After a brief review of the salient features of chiral metamaterials, such as giant optical activity, circular dichroism, and negative refractive index, the common method for the retrieval of effective parameters for chiral metamaterials is surveyed. Then, we introduce some typical chiral structures, e.g., chiral metamaterial consisting of split ring resonators, complementary chiral metamaterial, and composite chiral metamaterial, on the basis of the studies of the authors' group. The coupling effect during the construction of bulk chiral metamaterials is mentioned and discussed.We introduce the application of bianisotropic chiral structures in the field of asymmetric transmission. Finally, we mention a few directions for future research on chiral metamaterials.},

It is becoming clear that the first generation of metamaterial-based devices will most probably arise from their two-dimensional equivalents [mdash] metasurfaces. In this Review, we describe recent progress in the area of metasurfaces formed from plasmonic meta-atoms. In particular, we approach the subject from the perspective of the fundamental excitations supported by the meta-atoms and the interactions between them.

abstract = {As an emerging three-dimensional chiral metamaterial, plasmonic nanospirals (NSs) possess inherent chiroptical activity that has attracted increasing attention for developing potential photonic applications. However, the study of chiroptical activity of plasmonic NSs is still in its infancy, especially for NSs made of silver, which is a typical plasmonic material with high plasmonic quality. Herein, we present a systematic study of circular dichroism (CD) of silver NSs (AgNSs) that are fabricated and engineered in helical lengths by glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) and dispersed in ethanol. The CD spectrum is composed of a bisignated mode of two peaks, one in the UV regime and the other in the visible. The UV mode has a resonance wavelength saturating at {\~{}}375 nm and a linewidth decoupled from the helical elongation, while the visible mode tends to have a redshift and its linewidth broadens linearly with the elongation of AgNS. Helical elongation generally amplifies the chiroptical activity of both modes. Finite-element simulation shows good agreement with the experimental CD results, and accounts for the wavelength-related chiroptical distinction in terms of the resonance wavelength. This work contributes to understanding the bisignated chiroptical responses of plasmonic nanospirals, and introduces a simple method to tailor the visible chiroptical activity that is strongly desired to explore a wide range of chirality-related bio-applications.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic metamaterials are composed of periodically arranged artificial structures. They show peculiar properties, such as negative refraction and super-lensing, which are not seen in natural materials. The conventional metamaterials require both negative and negative $\mu$ to achieve negative refraction. Chiral metamaterial is a new class of metamaterials offering a simpler route to negative refraction. In this paper, we briefly review the history of metamaterials and the developments on chiral metamaterials. We study the wave propagation properties in chiral metamaterials and show that negative refraction can be realized in chiral metamaterials with a strong chirality, with neither nor $\mu$ negative required. We have developed a retrieval procedure, adopting a uniaxial bi-isotropic model to calculate the effective parameters such as n ± , $\kappa$, and $\mu$ of the chiral metamaterials. Our work on the design, numerical calculations and experimental measurements of chiral metamaterials is introduced. Strong chiral behaviors such as optical activity and circular dichroism are observed and negative refraction is obtained for circularly polarized waves in these chiral metamaterials. We show that 3D isotropic chiral metamaterials can eventually be realized.},

abstract = {Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7-9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate 'wave' in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. This chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2-5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and 'hot spots'. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring.},

@article{Abdulrahman2013a,
abstract = {We demonstrate that engineered artificial gold chiral nanostructures display significant levels of non-linear optical activity even without plasmonic enhancement. Our work suggests that although plasmonic excitation enhances the intensity of second harmonic emission it is not a prerequisite for significant non-linear (second harmonic) optical activity. It is also shown that the non-linear optical activities of both the chiral nanostructures and simple chiral molecules on surfaces have a common origin, namely pure electric dipole excitation. This is a surprising observation given the significant difference in length scales, three orders of magnitude, between the nanostructures and simple chiral molecules. Intuitively, given that the dimensions of the nanostructures are comparable to the wavelength of visible light, one would expect non-localised higher multipole excitation (e.g. electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole) to make the dominant contribution to non-linear optical activity. This study provides experimental evidence that the electric dipole origin of non-linear optical activity is a generic phenomenon which is not limited to sub-wavelength molecules and assemblies. Our work suggests that viewing non-plasmonic nanostructures as “meta-molecules” could be useful for rationally designing substrates for optimal non-linear optical activity.},

These crystals can effectively differentiate between counter-propagating light beams and show directional optical anisotropies -- such as directional dichroism -- in the order of unity. Based on symmetry considerations, we identify the magnetic point groups of materials which can host such directional anisotropy. In most of these cases, we found that the symmetry of the crystal allows non-reciprocity not only for optical processes but also for the propagation of unpolarized beams of particles and scalar waves. We also predict new types of non-reciprocal optical anisotropies -- besides the optical magnetoelectric effect and the magnetochiral dichroism investigated so far -- and specify the magnetic point group of crystals which can host them.},

The amount of ligands bonded to the surface of nanoparticles was quantified by absorption spectroscopy. Quantification was performed indirectly by measuring concentration of free ligands in solution after incubation with absorption labels 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride or 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Data were obtained for ligands at concentration levels from 10-6 to 10-3molL-1. The results showed the significantly lower adsorbed molecules of methyl derivatives of cysteine than for cysteine themselves. This fact could explain the unexpected behavior of silver nanoparticles that provide ECD bands in the presence of cysteine and not in the presence of its derivatives.},

The nonlinear polarization and magnetization of the surface as well as the second‐harmonic fields that are radiated in the reflected and transmitted directions are expressed in terms of the six possible bilinear combinations of the components of the electric field of the fundamental beam. For the case in which the polarization of the fundamental beam is controlled by means of a quarter‐wave plate between p‐polarized linear and left‐ and right‐hand circular, the second‐harmonic fields can be expanded in terms of only three different functions of the rotation angle of the wave plate. The process exhibits nonlinear optical activity, i.e., it responds differently to the two circular polarizations of the fundamental beam if the phases of certain expansion coefficients are different. The theory is used to explain the results of a recent experiment and excellent agreement is found. The results suggest that in the experiment the largest components of the susceptibility tensors that include magnetic contributions were of the order of ∼10{\%} of those of the electric dipole‐allowed susceptibility tensor.},

We take advantage of this property to demonstrate the use of circularly polarized second-harmonic generation microscopy toward the efficient read-out of a microscopic pattern encoded by an array of triangular gold nanoprisms forming arrangements of adequate chiral symmetry. Strong chiroptical effects are observed in the backscattered second-harmonic generation intensity, enabling clear distinction of the laterally arranged enantiomers, down to nearly 1 $\mu$m resolution, with an overall intensity contrast of about 40{\%} (second-harmonic generation circular dichroism of 20{\%}). Numerical simulations show a noticeable change in the spatial distribution of plasmonic hot spots within the individual nanostructures under excitation by circularly polarized light of different handedness. This leads to rather weak chiroptical effect in the linear backscattering (theoretic...},

A new strategy for controlling the hot spots based circular dichroism (CD)-active sites in plasmonic polymers was developed to realize tailored and reproducible chiroptical activity in a controlled way. We showed that by regulating the bond angles between adjacent nanorods and the degree of polymerization in the linear plasmonic polymer, weak molecular chirality in the ultraviolet spectral region can be amplified by more than two orders of magnitude via the induced CD response in the visible/near infrared region. We demonstrate that this plasmonic polymer can be used to provide not only the Raman “fingerprint” information for identifying the molecular identity but also the CD signatures for (i) resolving the enantiomeric pairs of cysteine molecules at a small quantity level, and (ii) quantifying the enantiomeric purity of the chiral analytes. Chiral analyses by chiroptically responsive plasmonic polymers may find important applications in bioscience and biomedicine.},

abstract = {In this article, we present an efficient technique for the accurate design of wideband substrate integrate waveguide directional couplers. By tapering the coupling sec- tion, the bandwidth of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) directional couplers can be enlarged. Two design aspects are involved in this approach. First, the even-mode propaga- tion constant in the tapered coupling section is accurately extracted with the help of a nu- merical thru-reflect-line calibration technique. Then, it is fitted into the model of a uniform dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide and thereafter extrapolated to the operation range of the odd mode. Second, equivalent circuit models of the waveguide bifurcation effects are also presented together with parametric values. Based on the results of extraction, a 90? 3- dB directional coupler is developed to validate the proposed design approach. To achieve the reverse phasing at two output ports, the prototyped 90? 3-dB directional coupler is sub- sequently integrated with a novel broadband fixed phase shifter developed with the SIW technology, of which a systematic synthesis procedure has been proposed in this article. Measured performance of both 90? and 180? 3-dB couplers confirms the accuracy of our proposed design approach. This kind of wide-band directional coupler can find applications C in wideband power dividing/combining circuits within a single-layer platform.},

@article{Govorov2010,
abstract = {Our calculations show that a nonchiral nanocrystal is able to dramatically change the circular dichroism (CD) of a chiral molecule when the nanocrystal and molecule form a complex and couple via dipole and multipole Coulomb interactions. Plasmon resonances of metal nanocrystals in the nanocrystal-molecule complex result in both the resonant enhancement of CD signals of molecules and the appearance of new spectral structures. Two mechanisms, in which a nanocrystal can influence the CD effect, have been identified. The first mechanism is the plasmon-induced change in the electromagnetic field inside the chiral molecule. The second is the optical absorption of the nanocrystal-molecule complex due to the chiral currents inside the metal nanocrystal induced by the dipole of the chiral molecule. The first mechanism creates a change in the angle between the effective electric and magnetic dipoles of the molecule. This mechanism can lead to symmetry breaking and to a plasmon-induced CD signal of the nonchiral molecule. Both mechanisms create interesting Fano-like shapes in the CD spectra. Importantly, the second mechanism gives the main contribution to the CD signal at the plasmon frequency when the absorption band of the chiral molecule is far from the plasmon resonance. This may happen in many cases since many biomolecules are optically active in the UV range, whereas plasmon resonances in commonly used nanometals are found at longer wavelengths. As concrete examples, the paper describes alpha-helix and calixarene ligand molecules coupled with metal nanocrystals. The above results are also applied to complexes incorporating semiconductor nanocrystals. The results obtained here can be used to design a variety of hybrid nanostructures with enhanced and tailored optical chirality in the visible wavelength range.},

Recently, the chirality of these materials has attracted attention, and application to chiral technologies is an interesting perspective. This minireview deals with the preparation of chiral gold nanoparticles and their chiroptical properties. On the basis of the latter, together with predictions from quantum chemical calculations, we discuss different models that were put forward in the past to rationalize the observed optical activity in metal-based electronic transitions. We furthermore critically discuss these models in view of recent results on the structure determination of some gold clusters as well as ligand-exchange experiments examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. It is also demonstrated that vibrational circular dichroism can be used to determine the structure of a chiral adsorbate and the way it interacts with the metal. Finally, possible applications of these new chiral materials are discussed.},

Smaller number of particles and different chiral geometries taking advantage of the self-organization capabilities of nanomaterials will advance understanding of chiral plasmonic effects, facilitate development of their theory, and stimulate practical applications of chiroplasmonics. Here we show that gold nanorods self-assemble into side-by-side orientated pairs and "ladders" in which chiral properties originate from the small dihedral angle between them. Spontaneous twisting of one nanorod versus the other one breaks the centrosymmetric nature of the parallel assemblies. Two possible enantiomeric conformations with positive and negative dihedral angles were obtained with different assembly triggers. The chiral nature of the angled nanorod pairs was confirmed by 4$\pi$ full space simulations and the first example of single-particle CD spectroscopy. Self-assembled nanorod pairs and "ladders" enable the development of chiral metamaterials, (bio)sensors, and new catalytic processes.[on SciFinder (R)]},

Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on $\alpha$Syn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the $\alpha$Syn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of $\alpha$Syn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.},

In the present study, we have measured the circular and linear dichroism (CD and LD) spectra and the circular and linear birefringence (CB and LB) spectra of the CLM cell itself as well as those of porphyrine aggregates formed at the liquid-liquid interface in the CLM cell, applying Mueller matrix measurement method. From the results, it was confirmed that the CLM-CD spectra of the interfacial porphyrin aggregates observed by a conventional CD spectropolarimeter should be correct irrespective of LD and LB signals in the CLM cell.},

Basic phenomena of reflection and refraction at the boundary of a chiral medium are considered and NR is demonstrated for frequencies below wL as following from the negative group velocity of circularly polarized electromagnetic waves of one handedness. We show that specular reflection of the polarized waves should provide a means of direct experimental detection of this frequency domain. We also discuss dissipation-related limitations for realization of NR.},

abstract = {Chiral fields with large optical chirality are very important in chiral molecules analysis, sensing and other measurements. Plasmonic nanostructures have been proposed to realize such super chiral fields for enhancing weak chiral signals. However, most of them cannot provide uniform chiral near‐fields close to the structures, which makes these nanostructures not so efficient for applications. Plasmonic helical nanostructures and blocked squares have been proved to provide uniform chiral near‐fields, but structure fabrication is a challenge. In this paper, we show that very simple plasmonic dimer structures can provide uniform chiral fields in the gaps with large enhancement of both near electric fields and chiral fields under linearly polarized light illumination with polarization off the dimer axis at dipole resonance. 30 times of volume averaged chiral field enhancement is gotten in the whole gap. Chiral fields with opposite handedness can be obtained simply by changing the polarization to the other side of the dimer axis. It is especially useful in Raman optical activity measurement and chiral sensing of small quantity of chiral molecule.},

abstract = {We report hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of five different shapes, quasi-spherical (∼10 and ∼20 nm diameter), rod (aspect ratio ∼2), and branched shapes, tetrapod, flower and star with 800 nm, 150 fs laser excitation. Using ∼10 nm spherical GNPs as reference, the first hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) values were calculated for all other shapes. Star and flower shaped GNPs have the highest hyperpolarizability (∼130 and ∼52 times higher, respectively), while rod and tetrapod shaped GNPs only have modest enhancement (∼7 times), which is similar to ∼20 nm size quasi-spherical particles. These enhancements are attributed to reduced symmetry as well as the presence of sharp tips on GNP surface. When the $\beta$ values are normalized with respect to the number of atoms per particle, the flower and star shaped GNPs still have the highest hyperpolarizability values. The polar plots of vertically polarized HRS signal as a function of the angle of polarization of the incoming incident light shows two lobes, indicating that excitation is predominantly dipolar in nature although the size of some GNPs are big enough to show a quadrupolar response. It is believed that the presence of sharp tips at the surface of these large sized GNPs is responsible for the observed dipolar response. This study shows that GNPs having sharp tips might be a better candidate when their nonlinear properties are used for sensing applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The most well-known examples include the role of mirror symmetry breaking for the generation of even harmonics, and the selection rule related to the rotation symmetry in harmonic generation for fundamental beams with circular polarizations. While the role of mirror symmetry breaking in second harmonic generation has been extensively studied in plasmonic systems, the investigation on selection rules pertaining to circular polarization states of harmonic generation has been limited to crystals, i.e. symmetries at the atomic level. Here we demonstrate the rotational symmetry dependent third harmonic generation from nonlinear plasmonic metacrystals. We show that the selection rule can be imposed by the rotational symmetry of meta-crystals embedded into an isotropic organic nonlinear thin film. The results presented here may open new avenues for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical responses with tailored plasmonic nanostructures.},

abstract = {Fully light-based circuits are becoming a realistic possibility due to the recent advances in metamaterials. The latter are artificial materials engineered for displaying unusual optical properties, such as negative refractive index,[1] extraordinary transmission,[2] superlensing, cloaking etc.[3] In an optical nanocircuit, metamaterials could take the place of standard electronic components.[4–6] In such devices, light waves would be used instead of electrons. The possibility arises from the fact that light waves can couple to collective excitations of electrons at the surfaces of metallic nanostructures, a prop- erty referred to as surface plasmon resonance. Because these optically induced resonances occur at the surfaces and interfaces of the nanostructures, they can readily be investigated with a surface- and interface-specific optical technique, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG). SHG is a nonlinear optical technique that, within the dipole approximation, is forbidden in materials with a center of symmetry. Consequently, SHG is highly sensitive to regions with broken symmetry, such as surfaces (or interfaces), and it has been successfully applied to the study of plasmonic nano- materials with different geometries.[7–10] Of particular interest here is the U-shaped nanostructure geometry. This type of structure has attracted a lot of atten- tion due to its particular resonances,[11] magnetism,[12] and possible negative index of refraction.[13] The letter U has two extremities that are alike (same size, parallel) and yet},

abstract = {We review the theory of the Casimir effect using scattering techniques. After years of theoretical effort, this formalism is now largely mastered so that the accuracy of theory–experiment comparisons is determined by the level of precision and pertinence of the description of experimental conditions. Due to an imperfect knowledge of the optical properties of real mirrors used in the experiment, the effect of imperfect reflection remains a source of uncertainty in theory–experiment comparisons. For the same reason, the temperature dependence of the Casimir force between dissipative mirrors remains a matter of debate. We also emphasize that real mirrors do not obey exactly the assumption of specular reflection, which is used in nearly all calculations of material and temperature corrections. This difficulty may be solved by using a more general scattering formalism accounting for non-specular reflection with wavevectors and field polarizations mixed. This general formalism has already been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect of roughness on the Casimir force as well as the lateral Casimir force appearing between corrugated surfaces. The commonly used 'proximity force approximation (PFA)' turns out to lead to inaccuracies in the description of these two effects.},

The chiral selectivity is attributed to favorable chemical interactions that the molecular tips form with only one of two enantiomers. The stereoselective observation reveals spatial distribution of the enantiomers on a surface at the molecular level.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Miniaturization down to the nanoscale has enabled a new paradigm of ultrathin optical devices, capable of manipulating the direction, polarization, and frequency of light. Great interest is drawn by the promising prospects of deep-subwavelength material dimensions. However, interesting properties and opportunities offered by structures with sizes comparable to the wavelength of light appear to have been overlooked. Here, quasiplanar chiral arrays made of gold are considered and show that higher-order diffracted beams can yield extremely large chiroptical responses for optical frequencies. The chosen sample geometry demonstrates spectrally tunable polarization conversion and extremely large circular dichroism. Experimental and numerical data are in good agreement, for both sample chiral forms, and for the complementary geometries under Babinet's principle. Specifically, the experimental results show that the fractional circular dichroism (CD) can be as high as 20{\%}, in the third-order diffraction beam. Based on the numerical results, a great potential for improvement is anticipated, which makes higher-order diffraction CD a very promising candidate for ultrathin optical applications.},

abstract = {Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) have been reviewed herein for their
fascinating optical properties in a wide spectral range and for their
various applications. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands of metal
NPs can be tuned from visible to near infrared region by varying the
shape of the metal NPs. As a result, the tuning of the SPR band over a
spectral range is possible by making plasmonic NPs of different shapes.
This review emphasizes fundamental studies of plasmonic NPs and
nanocomposites with well-defined and controlled shapes that have several
analytical applications such as molecular detection and determination in
different fields. This review describes how oxidative etching and
kinetic control can be utilized to manipulate the shape and optical
properties of NPs. This review also describes the specific examples of
the sensing applications of the localized surface plasmon resonance
studies in which the researchers use both wavelength shift and
surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing to detect the molecules of
chemical and biological relevance. The review ends with a perspective of
the field, identifying the main challenges to be overcome and suggesting
areas where the most promising developments are likely to happen in

To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

@article{Dreaden2011,
abstract = {The authors report on surface-enhanced Raman scattering of Si phonon vibrations from arrays of Au nanoprism pairs fabricated by electron beam lithog. Resonant excitation of the quadrupolar surface plasmon mode of the nanoprisms increases Raman scattering intensity from the substrate as the distance between the nanoparticle pairs decreases. Finite element modeling and plasmon coupling theory indicate that symmetry is reduced as the nanoparticles approach, resulting in increased dipole-quadrupole coupling. Plasmonic enhancement of the incident and Raman-scattered photons results from the dipolar component of the mixed plasmonic field. This effect is expected to be largest in assemblies/aggregates of nanoparticles. (c) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{Huang2016,
abstract = {For the attractive plasmonic structure consisting of metal nanoparticles (NPs) on a mirror, the coexistence of near-field NP-NP and NP-mirror couplings is numerically studied at normal incidence. By mapping their 3D surface charge distributions directly, we have demonstrated two different kinds of mirror-induced bonding dipole plasmon modes and confirmed the bonding hybridizations of the mirror and the NP-dimer which may offer a much stronger near-field enhancement than that of the isolated NP dimers over a broad wavelength range. Further, it is revealed that the huge near-field enhancement of these two modes exhibit different dependence on the NP-NP and NP-mirror hot spots, while both of their near-field resonance wavelengths can be tuned to the blue exponentially by increasing the NP-NP gaps or the NP-mirror separation. Our results here benifit significantly the fundamental understanding and practical applications of metallic NPs on a mirror in plasmonics.},

@article{Lee2016,
abstract = {Arrays of sub-wavelength, sub-10 nm air-gap plasmonic ring resonators are fabricated using nanoimprinting. In near infra-red (NIR) range, the resonator supports a single dipole mode which is excited and identified via simple normal illumination and explored through transmission measurements. By controlling both lateral and vertical confinement via a metal edge, the mode volume is successfully reduced down to 1.3 × 10 -5 $\lambda$ 0 3 . The advantage of such mode confinement is demonstrated by applying the resonators biosensing. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules, a dramatic enhancement of surface sensitivity up to 69 nm/nm is achieved as the modal height approaches the thickness of the adsorbed molecule layers.},

@article{Blackie2009,
abstract = {Single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of nonresonant molecules is demonstrated experimentally using the bianalyte SERS method. To this end, bianalyte SERS is performed at 633 nm excitation using the nonresonant molecule 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (BPE) in combination with a benzotriazole derivative as a partner. The results are then extended to the even more challenging case of a small nonresonant molecule, adenine, using an isotopically substituted adenine as bianalyte SERS partners. In addition, SERS cross sections of single-molecule events are quantified, thus providing estimates of the enhancement factors needed to see them. It turns out that an enhancement factor on the order of ∼5 × 109 was sufficient for single-molecule detection of BPE, while maximum enhancement factors of ∼5 × 1010 were observed in extreme cases. In the case of adenine, single-molecule detection was only possible in the rare cases with enhancement factors of ∼1011. This study constitutes a quantitati...},

@article{LeRu2007,
abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth study of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs) and cross-sections, including several issues often overlooked. In particular, various possible rigorous definitions of the SERS EFs are introduced and discussed in the context of SERS applications, such as analytical chemistry and single molecule SERS. These definitions highlight the importance of a careful characterization of the non-SERS cross-sections of the probes under consideration. This aspect is illustrated by experimental results for the non-SERS cross-sections of representative SERS probes along with average SERS EFs for the same probes. In addition, the accurate experimental determination of single molecule enhancement factors is tackled with two recently developed techniques, namely: bi-analyte SERS (BiASERS) and temperature-dependent SERS vibrational pumping. We demonstrate that SERS EFs as low as 10(7), as opposed to the figure of 10(14) often claimed in the literature, are sufficient for the observation of single molecule SERS signals, with maximum single molecule EFs typically on the order of similar to 10(14).},

@article{Wenzel2008,
abstract = {We report on the implementation of metal nanoparticles as probes for scattering and apertureless near-field optical investigations in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral regime. At these wavelengths, an efficient electric-field confinement is necessary and achieved here through a gold metal nanoparticle of 80 nm in diameter (Au80-MNP) acting as the optical antenna. The Au80-MNP is attached to a standard AFM cantilever used as the spatial manipulator. When approached to a sample surface while being illuminated with an infrared beam, the Au80-MNP produces a considerably improved spatial confinement of the electric field compared to an ordinary scattering AFM tip. We demonstrate here the confinement normal to the sample surface by making use of a sample-induced phonon polariton resonance in a ferroelectric lithium niobate sample. Our experimental findings are in very good agreement with the quasistatic dipole model and show improved optical resolution via well-selected antenna particles.},

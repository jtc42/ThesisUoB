abstract = {Knotted fields are an emerging research topic relevant to different areas of physics where topology plays a crucial role. Recent realization of knotted nematic disclinations stabilized by colloidal particles raised a challenge of free-standing knots. Here we demonstrate the creation of free-standing knotted and linked disclination loops in the cholesteric ordering fields, which are confined to spherical droplets with homeotropic surface anchoring. Our approach, using free energy minimization and topological theory, leads to the stabilization of knots via the interplay of the geometric frustration and intrinsic chirality. Selected configurations of the lowest complexity are characterized by knot or link types, disclination lengths and self-linking numbers. When cholesteric pitch becomes short on the confinement scale, the knotted structures change to practically unperturbed cholesteric structures with disclinations expelled close to the surface. The drops with knots could be controlled by optical beams and may be used for photonic elements.},

abstract = {The interaction between individual plasmonic nanoparticles plays a crucial role in tuning and shaping the surface plasmon resonances of a composite structure. Here, we demonstrate that the detailed character of the coupling between plasmonic structures can be captured by a modified "circuit" model. This approach is generally applicable and, as an example here, is applied to a dolmen-like nanostructure consisting of a vertically placed gold monomer slab and two horizontally placed dimer slabs. By utilizing the full-wave eigenmode expansion method (EEM), we extract the eigenmodes and eigenvalues for these constituting elements and reduce their electromagnetic interaction to the structures' mode interactions. Using the reaction concept, we further summarize the mode interactions within a "coupling" matrix. When the driving voltage source imposed by the incident light is identified, an equivalent circuit model can be constructed. Within this model, hybridization of the plasmonic modes in the constituting nanostructure elements is discussed. The proposed circuit model allows the reuse of powerful circuit analysis techniques in the context of plasmonic structures. As an example, we derive an equivalent of Th{\'{e}}venin's theorem in circuit theory for nanostructures. Applying the equivalent Th{\'{e}}venin's theorem, the well-known Fano resonance is easily explained.},

abstract = {Photonics has the potential for processing information at unprecedented speeds and accommodates massively parallel data processing algorithms. To compete against electronics, photonic switches must allow for dense integration and surpass the gigahertz performance of electronic components. This requires a nonlinear switching medium with an as-yet unavailable ultrafast giant nonlinear response. Here, we show that a suitable switching material can be engineered by harnessing the nanoscale confinement of light and the nonlinearity of metal. Using a nanostructured gold film, we demonstrate resonant switching, the performance of which is at least one order of magnitude faster and stronger than designed materials reported so far. It exceeds electronic component speeds by a factor of a thousand and achieves control of light with light in a film only 50 nm thick at an average light power level of only a few milliwatts, thus providing a ground-breaking solution for all-optical data processing.},

It is becoming clear that the first generation of metamaterial-based devices will most probably arise from their two-dimensional equivalents [mdash] metasurfaces. In this Review, we describe recent progress in the area of metasurfaces formed from plasmonic meta-atoms. In particular, we approach the subject from the perspective of the fundamental excitations supported by the meta-atoms and the interactions between them. We also identify some areas ripe for future research and indicate likely avenues for future device development.},

abstract = {Circular dichroic (CD) ratios often exceeding 100{\%} have been reported in previous surface second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements of chiral surface films, offering promise for the development of unique characterization methods to study biologically interesting surface systems. In this work, the molecular and surface structural origins of these large dichroic differences were explored in theoretical treatments and modeling calculations. Several new conclusions were formed regarding chirality in electric dipole allowed SHG measurements; (1) SHG-CD is allowed even in uniaxial films of achiral chromophores, provided they assemble with asymmetry in the twist angle, (2) for systems dominated by one or more chiral tensor element, this same asymmetry in surface packing is required for SHG-CD to be observed, and (3) large SHG-CD ratios are predicted in standard reflection and transmission measurements of ultrathin films in systems with spectral overlap between multiple excited states. The methodology described provides a formalism to aid in extracting structural information from nonlinear optical measurements of chiral films. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Recently, remarkable advances have been made in coupling a number of high-Q modes of nano-mechanical systems to high-finesse optical cavities, with the goal of reaching regimes in which quantum behavior can be observed and leveraged toward new applications. To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present a theory of second-harmonic generation from thin films of chiral materials. The formalism makes distinct the contributions of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions to the radiative process. Three susceptibility tensors form a minimal description of the optical nonlinearity, two for the nonlinear surface polarization and one for the nonlinear surface magnetization. The influence of optical interfaces is made explicit by using Fresnel coefficients to describe the reflection and transmission of the fundamental and second-harmonic radiation. Hence, the characterization and metrology of chiral materials by surface second-harmonic generation are given a firm theoretical foundation. In agreement with recent experimental observations, second-harmonic signals from chiral surfaces are predicted to depend sensitively upon whether the fundamental light is right- or left-hand circularly polarized. We show that this second-harmonic-generation circular-dichroism effect is a key signature of chirality and originates fundamentally from contributions of magnetic-dipole transitions to the nonlinear polarization and magnetization of the surface.},

The observed directional circular dichroism of our switchable plasmonic material is in good agreement with predictions based on dipole approximation theory. Such dynamic metamaterials introduce functionality into soft matter-based optical devices and may enable novel data storage schemes or signal modulators.},

We show that nonlinear techniques open entirely new ways of exploring chirality in chemical and biological systems: The cubic processes give rise to nonlinear circular dichroism and nonlinear optical rotation and make it possible to observe dynamic chiral processes at ultrafast time scales. The quadratic second-harmonic and sum-frequency-generation phenomena and the quartic processes may arise entirely in the electric-dipole approximation and do not require the use of circularly polarized light to detect chirality. They provide surface selectivity and their observables can be relatively much larger than in linear optical activity. These processes also give rise to the generation of light at a new color, and in liquids this frequency conversion only occurs if the solution is optically active. We survey recent chiral nonlinear optical experiments and give examples of their application to problems of biophysical interest.},

The most widely used applications of protein CD are to determine whether an expressed, purified protein is folded, or if a mutation affects its conformation or stability. In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions. This protocol details the basic steps of obtaining and interpreting CD data, and methods for analyzing spectra to estimate the secondary structural composition of proteins. CD has the advantage that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing {\textless} or =20 microg of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours. However, it does not give the residue-specific information that can be obtained by x-ray crystallography or NMR.},

The TPL intensity of gold plates decreases with the increase of the excitation wavelength except for a small peak around 820–840 nm, while SHG intensity increases with the excitation wavelength redshift. In addition, it is found that the TPL intensity of the gold plate's edge is related with the angle between the edge orientation and the polarization direction of the excitation light. The TPL intensity increases with the angle increase from 0° to 90°.},

Here we report on an ultracompact circularly polarized light detector that combines large engineered chirality, realized using chiral plasmonic metamaterials, with hot electron injection. We demonstrate the detector's ability to distinguish between left and right hand circularly polarized light without the use of additional optical elements. Implementation of this photodetector could lead to enhanced security in fibre and free-space communication, as well as emission, imaging and sensing applications for circularly polarized light using a highly integrated photonic platform.},

First, we consider the allowed configurations of the fields and field gradients at a single point in space. Many configurations cannot be generated from a single plane wave, regardless of polarization, but any allowed configuration can be generated by superposition of multiple plane waves. There is no local configuration of the fields and gradients that requires near-field effects. Second, we derive a set of local electromagnetic quantities, each of which couples to a particular multipole transition. These quantities are small or zero in plane waves, but can be large in regions of certain superpositions of plane waves. Our findings provide a systematic framework for designing far-field and near-field experiments to drive multipole transitions. The proposed experiments provide information on molecular structure that is inaccessible to other spectroscopic techniques and open the possibility for new types of optical control of molecules.},

abstract = {Resorcinol-dodecanal cyclotetramer 1 as an achiral host in chloroform forms hydrogen-bonded complexes with a variety of chiral di(poly)ols (2-24) including steroids and sugars. The complexation processes can be followed very conveniently by the induced circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The binding constants as determined by CD titration increase in the order 15 (steroidal monool, K = 8.7 M-1) {\textless} 3, 6, and 8 (acyclic glycols, (4.9-7.1 x 10) {\textless} 9-alpha, 10-alpha, 12, and 13 (cyclic glycols and steroidal diols, (0.94-2.7) x 10(2)) {\textless} 11 (steroidal triol, 6.9 x 10(2)). This order reflects the extents of multiple host-guest hydrogen-bonding interactions. All of the resulting complexes exhibit CD with split Cotton effects as a result of exciton chirality induction in otherwise symmetric 1 upon binding of a chiral guest. The signs of split Cotton effects for complexes derived from glycols are correlated with the chiralities or absolute configurations of the guests, while those for sugar complexes are governed by the ring conformations (C1 or 1C) of sugar pyranoses. These results suggest that host 1 can be used as a novel, supramolecular probe for the assignments of stereochemistry of chiral guests.},

Some unexplained properties of the electromagnetic-wave propagation through these media, revealed by closer inspection of previous numerical simulations and experimental work, are highlighted. It is shown that these peculiarities are properly explained if the bianisotropy is explicitly accounted for. The bianisotropy is related to the existence of magnetoelectric coupling in the artificial constituents (artificial atoms) of the medium. A simple modification of the artificial atom that precludes the bianisotropy is also proposed.},

These effects are strong (∼10−1), despite the weak circular dichroism of the particles (∼10−5). We further show that C represents the chiral selectivity of the near-field coupling between an emitter and a nanoantenna.},

@article{Coles2012a,
abstract = {This paper develops, in precise quantum electrodynamic terms, photonic attributes of the “optical chirality density,” one of several measures long known to be conserved quantities for a vacuum electromagnetic field. The analysis lends insights into some recent interpretations of chiroptical experiments, in which this measure, and an associated chirality flux, have been treated as representing physically distinctive “superchiral” phenomena. In the fully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status, whose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals relationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing multimode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian modes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical chirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due cognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin-angular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is shown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic radiation have a common basis in differences between the populations of optical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a calculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent states to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms contribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the difference in left- and right-handed photon populations; the only other contribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance dependence corresponding to the claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon number-phase uncertainty relation. From the full analysis, it appears that the term “superchiral” can be considered redundant.},

Such optical activity can occur in the electric-dipole approximation. However, to explain our results for chiral polymer films, magnetic contributions to the nonlinearity must be included. A technique that uses a quarter wave plate to continuously vary the polarization of the fundamental beam was used to determine the relative complex values of the components of the tensors that characterize the nonlinear interaction. The largest magnetic components were not, vert, similar 20{\%} of the largest electric components. Second-harmonic generation from achiral anisotropic surfaces can also lead to optical activity. This occurs if the orientation of the anisotropic sample makes an otherwise achiral experimental arrangement chiral. The effect occurs in the electric-dipole approximation and changes sign as the handedness of the setup is reversed.},

Chiral materials occur in two enantiomers, which are mirror images of each other. In recent years, chiral metamaterials based on metal nanostructures have been shown to lead to greatly enhanced OA effects in the linear optical response [2,3]. On the other hand, second-harmonic generation (SHG) from ideally achiral metal nanostructures is extremely sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking due to surface defects [4]. It is therefore important to study whether nonlinear techniques can be used as a probe of the handedness of chiral metamaterials fabricated using state-of-the art techniques. Here we demonstrate that SHG microscopy with circularly-polarized light possesses an unambiguous sensitivity to the handedness of twisted-cross metamaterials to the level of individual subwavelength-sized nano-objects.},

Cavity optomechanical systems, in which a high-quality optical resonator is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator, hold great promise as a route towards the observation of such effects with macroscopic oscillators. Here, we present measurements on optomechanical systems exhibiting radiofrequency (62-122 MHz) mechanical modes, cooled to very low occupancy using a combination of cryogenic precooling and resolved-sideband laser cooling. The lowest achieved occupancy is n similar to 63. Optical measurements of these ultracold oscillators' motion are shown to perform in a near-ideal manner, exhibiting an imprecision-backaction product about one order of magnitude lower than the results obtained with nano-electromechanical transducers.},

abstract = {Using SQUID magnetometry techniques, we have studied the change in magnetization versus applied ac electric field, i.e. the magnetoelectric (ME) susceptibility dM/dE, in the chiral-lattice ME insulator Cu2OSeO3. Measurements of the dM/dE response provide a sensitive and efficient probe of the magnetic phase diagram, and we observe clearly distinct responses for the different magnetic phases, including the skyrmion lattice phase. By combining our results with theoretical calculation, we estimate quantitatively the ME coupling strength as {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}} = 0.0146 meV/(V/nm) in the conical phase. Our study demonstrates the ME susceptibility to be a powerful, sensitive and efficient technique for both characterizing and discovering new multiferroic materials and phases.},

abstract = {Recently, a great amount of research has been triggered by the prediction, formulated by Pendry and co-authors, that novel and enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena could be observed in metamaterials.[1] This prediction is based on the fact that, in metamaterials, local field enhancements can have a dramatic influence over the optical properties of the material. One of the largest contributions to such local field enhancements is attributable to surface plasmon resonances. Plasmons are collective oscillations of the electrons under the influence of light's electromagnetic field. Plasmons occur naturally on the surfaces of homogeneous metal films, where they usually dissipate quickly and cancel each other's influence. However, upon patterning the metal surface at the nanoscale, plasmons can be manipulated in a manner similar to classical waveguiding, whereby propagation or standing wave patterns can be achieved. In other words, artificial structuring allows for nanoengineering the position and intensity of the local fields. Incidentally, nonlinear optical effects, such as second-, third-, or forth-harmonic generation, scale as the second, third or fourth power of the electromagnetic intensity, respectively. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the large electromagnetic local field enhancements in metamaterials should yield large or previously unobserved nonlinear optical effects.},

By utilizing this optical arrangement, the detection of chirality originating from melittin adsorbed to a planar supported lipid bilayer has been performed for the first time by C-SHG. Melittin binding to the membrane was monitored as a function of bulk concentration through detection of the C-SHG signal. Analysis of the C-SHG adsorption isotherms reveals Frumkin adsorption behavior with a positive interaction energy. The binding constant (Ka) obtained was determined to be (8.3 +/- 1.0) x 105 M-1. The results of these studies have far-reaching implication in the use of C-SHG for the label-free detection of protein association to surfaces and in the analysis of protein interfacial phenomena.},

The basic mechanism of excitation of such modes inside the nanoparticles is very similar to that of split-ring resonators, but with one important difference that silicon nanoparticles have much smaller losses and are able to shift the magnetic resonance wavelength down to visible frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that these nanoparticles have strong magnetic dipole resonance, which can be continuously tuned throughout the whole visible spectrum varying particle size and visually observed by means of dark-field optical microscopy.

The research agenda is now shifting towards achieving tunable, switchable, nonlinear and sensing functionalities. It is therefore timely to discuss the emerging field of metadevices where we define the devices as having unique and useful functionalities that are realized by structuring of functional matter on the subwavelength scale. In this Review we summarize research on photonic, terahertz and microwave electromagnetic metamaterials and metadevices with functionalities attained through the exploitation of phase-change media, semiconductors, graphene, carbon nanotubes and liquid crystals. The Review also encompasses microelectromechanical metadevices, metadevices engaging the nonlinear and quantum response of superconductors, electrostatic and optomechanical forces and nonlinear metadevices incorporating lumped nonlinear components.},

Indeed, the latter present a high surface-to-volume ratio, but even more importantly, they can exhibit strong near-field enhancements or "hot spots". Hot spots often appear as a result of geometric features on the nanoscale or surface plasmon resonances, which are collective electron oscillations on the surface that, on the nanoscale, can readily be excited by light. In the last 10 years, near-field hot spots have been responsible for dramatic developments in the field of nano-optics. In this Feature Article, the influence of hot spots on the SHG response of nanostructured metal surfaces is discussed on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. On the microscopic level, the nanostructured metal surfaces were characterized by scanning SHG microscopy, complemented by rigorous numerical simulations of the near-field and of the local electric currents at the fundamental frequency. On the macroscopic level, SHG-circular dichroism and magnetization-induced SHG characterization techniques were employed.},

abstract = {The plant derived flavonoid compound quercetin, possesses wide range of biological activities in the human body by interacting with nucleic acids, enzymes and other proteins. As has recently been shown this molecule of polyphenolic type extensively binds to human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant carrier protein in the blood. Electronic absorption, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and molecular modelling methods were used to characterize optical properties of the quercetin-HSA complex, and to gain information on the binding mechanism at molecular level. The red shift and hypochromism of the longest-wavelength absorption band of quercetin relative to the spectral properties in ethanol suggests that one or more phenolic OH groups of the bound ligand is ionized and that the exocyclic phenyl ring is not coplanar with the benzopyrone moiety. It was found that quercetin shows extrinsic optical activity on interaction with HSA. The induced CD spectra were utilized to calculate the association constant at 37 degrees (1.46+/-0.21 x 10(4)M(-1)) and to probe the ligand binding site. Results of the CD displacement experiments performed with palmitic acid and salicylate were interpreted together with the findings of molecular modelling calculation performed on the quercetin-HSA complex. Computational mapping of possible binding sites of quercetin revealed the molecule to be bound in the large hydrophobic cavity of subdomain IIA. The protein microenvironment of this site was found to be rich in polar (basic) amino acid residues which are able to help to stabilize the negatively charged ligand bound in non-planar conformation. Additionally, the position of quercetin within the binding pocket allows simultaneous binding of other ligands such as warfarin, or sodium salycilate.},

The nanostructures are arranged in unit cells composed of four Gs, each rotated at 90 degrees with respect to its neighbors. As it has already been demonstrated, for linearly polarized light, these unit cells yield a pattern of four SHG hotspots. However, upon increasing the pitch of the nanostructured arrays, extra hotspots can be observed at the edges of the unit cells. While the origin of these extra hotspots remains to be elucidated, their position indicates a relationship to coupling behavior between the unit cells.},

abstract = {Light can exert radiation pressure on any object it encounters and that resulting optical force can be used to manipulate particles. It is commonly assumed that light should move a particle forward and indeed an incident plane wave with a photon momentum ħk can only push any particle, independent of its properties, in the direction of k. Here we demonstrate, using full-wave simulations, that an anomalous lateral force can be induced in a direction perpendicular to that of the incident photon momentum if a chiral particle is placed above a substrate that does not break any left-right symmetry. Analytical theory shows that the lateral force emerges from the coupling between structural chirality (the handedness of the chiral particle) and the light reflected from the substrate surface. Such coupling induces a sideway force that pushes chiral particles with opposite handedness in opposite directions.},

Several fundamental studies designed to elucidate the molecular and macromolecular origins of the chiral responses are reviewed to provide a framework for development of this emerging field. In general, the chiral activity in SHG and SFG has the potential to arise from complex interactions between hosts of different competing effects. Fortunately, relatively simple electric dipole-allowed mechanisms routinely dominate the nonlinear optical chiral activities of most practical systemsexpressions can often be generated to link the. This substantial reduction in complexity allows for the development of simple models connecting the macroscopic nonlinear optical response to intuitive molecular and supramolecular properties.},

The polarization of the surfaceSHG radiation is rotated with respect to that of the input fundamental radiation in a direction indicative of the chirality of the surface molecules. The origin of SHG‐ORD lies in the electric dipole‐allowed $\chi$(2)tensor elements, one of which is associated with the handedness of surface species. The SHG‐ORD rotation is independent of the density of surface species for an optically pure system, but is dependent on the chiral excess for mixtures of enantiomers. It is wavelength dependent but resonance is not required to observe the rotation. The experiments show that while SHG‐ORD has origins quite distinct from ordinary ORD, it can be utilized to measure chiralstructures of surfaces.},

The evident broad-band circular dichroism of the metamaterial is not a result of the intrinsic handeness of the constituent meta-atoms as in mainstream chiral designs but arises from the combined action of the anisotropy of each array of chains of nanoparticles, the gradual rotational twist of the metamaterial, and the strong electromagnetic coupling between adjacent layers of nanoparticle chains. As such, it is shown numerically that the degree of circular dichroism of the twisted metamaterial under study depends strongly on the twist angle between two successive lattices of nanoparticle chains and on the degree of anisotropy of each lattice.},

abstract = {The topic of quantum noise has become extremely timely due to the rise of quantum information physics and the resulting interchange of ideas between the condensed matter and AMO/quantum optics communities. This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the physics of quantum noise and its connections to quantum measurement and quantum amplification. After introducing quantum noise spectra and methods for their detection, we describe the basics of weak continuous measurements. Particular attention is given to treating the standard quantum limit on linear amplifiers and position detectors using a general linear-response framework. We show how this approach relates to the standard Haus-Caves quantum limit for a bosonic amplifier known in quantum optics, and illustrate its application for the case of electrical circuits, including mesoscopic detectors and resonant cavity detectors.},

Here, we take advantage of the low absorption loss as well as the simple unit cell geometry to demonstrate large-scale (centimeter-sized) all-dielectric metamaterial perfect reflectors made from silicon cylinder resonators. These perfect reflectors, operating in the telecommunications band, were fabricated using self-assembly based nanosphere lithography. In spite of the disorder originating from the self-assembly process, the average reflectance of the metamaterial perfect reflectors is 99.7{\%} at 1530 nm, surpassing the reflectance of metallic mirrors. Moreover, the spectral separation of the electric and magnetic resonances can be chosen to achieve the required reflection bandwidth while maintaining a high tolerance to disorder. The scalability of this design could lead to new avenues of manipulating light for low-loss and large-area photonic applications.},

The small size and mass of the nanoparticle yield high resonance frequencies and high quality factors along with low recoil heating, which are essential conditions for ground state cooling and for low decoherence. The trapping and cooling scheme presented here opens new routes for testing quantum mechanics with mesoscopic objects and for ultrasensitive metrology and sensing.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence of new measurement approaches and applications for chiral thin films and materials enabled by the observations of the high sensitivity of second-order nonlinear optical measurements to chirality. In thin films, the chiral response to second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation (SFG) from a single molecular monolayer is often comparable with the achiral response. The chiral specificity also allows for symmetry-allowed SFG in isotropic chiral media, confirming predictions made approximately 50 years ago. With these experimental demonstrations in hand, an important challenge is the construction of intuitive predictive models that allow the measured chiral response to be meaningfully related back to molecular and macromolecular structure. This review defines and considers three distinct mechanisms for chiral effects in uniaxially oriented assemblies: orientational chirality, intrinsic chirality, and isotropic chirality. The role of each is discussed in experimental and computational studies of bacteriorhodopsin films, binaphthol, and collagen. Collectively, these three model systems support a remarkably simple framework for quantitatively recovering the measured chiral-specific activity.},

Owing to the lack of inversion symmetry, these materials have been shown to display interesting physical properties such as negative index of refraction and giant optical activity. However, the biosensing capabilities of these chiral metamaterials have not been fully explored. Ultrasensitive detection and structural characterization of proteins adsorbed on chiral plasmonic substrates was demonstrated recently using UV-visible circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Second harmonic generation microscopy is an extremely sensitive nonlinear optical probe to investigate the chirality of biomaterials. In this study, we characterize the chiral response of chiral plasmonic metamaterials using second harmonic generation microscopy and CD spectroscopy. These planar chiral metamaterials, fabricated by electron-beam lithography, consist of right-handed and left-handed gold gammadions of length 400 nm and thickness 100nm, deposited on a glass substrate and arranged in a square lattice with a periodicity of 800nm.},

This probe proved successful for chirality sensing of several compounds, but in situ IR monitoring of the condensation reaction between the salicylaldehyde moiety in 1 and phenylglycinol showed that the imine formation takes 2 h. Optimization of the substrate binding rate and the circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence readouts led to the replacement of anthracene with smaller fluorophores capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 1-(3'-Formyl-4'-methoxyphenyl)-8-(4'-isoquinolyl)naphthalene N-oxide (2) and its pyridyl analogue 3 combine fast substrate binding with distinctive chiral amplification. This asymmetric transformation of the first kind prompts CD and fluorescence responses that can be used for in situ determination of the absolute configuration, ee, and total concentration of many compounds. The general utility of the three chemosensors was successfully tested on 18 substrates.},

abstract = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) has been used for the label-free detection of melittin upon intercalation into planar-supported lipid bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphotidylcholine (POPC). A novel counter-propagating SHG optical geometry was used to effectively isolate the achiral and chiral contributions of the surface, thus allowing for an investigation of both binding and structural contributions to melittin adsorption. Melittin binding to the membrane was monitored as a function of bulk concentration through detection of both the chiral and achiral SHG signal. Analysis of the SHG adsorption isotherms revealed Langmuir adsorption behavior for the achiral SH emission and Frumkin adsorption behavior for the chiral SH emission. The binding constants (Ka) obtained for the chiral and achiral SHG responses were determined to be 8.3??1.0??105 and 1.68??0.40??107M-1 respectively. The frequency dependent SHG response was also obtained for the achiral and chiral contributions. The SHG spectra show good correlation with the spectral transitions observed in both the UV-VIS and CD spectra of melittin in solution. The results of these studies have far reaching implications in the use of SHG for the analysis of protein interfacial phenomena. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A procedure is given to perform the inverse Fourier transformation relating a spatial Green's function to its spectral equivalent. The procedure is applied to the spectral Green's functions of the double scalar mixed-potential integral expression formulation of the electromagnetic field in a stratified dielectric medium. The extraction technique is used to annihilate every type of “problematic” behavior of the spectral Green's functions. Every annihilating function is inverse Fourier transformed analytically. It is shown that the annihilation of both the surface wave poles and the singularities at the branch point results in a set of analytical spatial functions, which are a very good approximation of the exact spatial Green's function down to relatively small lateral distances},

Electromagnetic fields may be chiral, too, with circularly polarized light (CPL) as the paradigmatic example. A recently introduced measure of the local degree of chiral dissymmetry in electromagnetic fields suggested the existence of optical modes more selective than circularly polarized plane waves in preferentially exciting single enantiomers in certain regions of space. By probing induced fluorescence intensity, we demonstrated experimentally an 11-fold enhancement over CPL in discrimination of the enantiomers of a biperylene derivative by precisely sculpted electromagnetic fields. This result, which agrees to within 15{\%} with theoretical predictions, establishes that optical chirality is a fundamental and tunable property of light, with possible applications ranging from plasmonic sensors to absolute asymmetric synthesis.},

Basic phenomena of reflection and refraction at the boundary of a chiral medium are considered and NR is demonstrated for frequencies below wL as following from the negative group velocity of circularly polarized electromagnetic waves of one handedness. We show that specular reflection of the polarized waves should provide a means of direct experimental detection of this frequency domain.

abstract = {We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix simulations on finite lengths of electromagnetic metamaterials, to determine the effective permittivity ͑␧͒ and permeability ͑␮͒. We perform this analysis on structures composed of periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators ͑SRRs͒, and both wires and SRRs. We find the recovered frequency-dependent ␧ and ␮ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of ␧ is negative, and SRRs produce a frequency region in which the real part of ␮ is negative. In the combination structure, at frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ␧ and ␮ are simultaneously negative, the real part of the index of refraction is also found to be unambiguously negative. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.65.195104 PACS number͑s͒: 41.20.Jb, 42.25.Bs, 73.20.Mf It has been proposed that electromagnetic metamaterials—composite structured materials, formed ei-ther from periodic or random arrays of scattering elements— should respond to electromagnetic radiation as continuous materials, at least in the long wavelength limit. 1,2 In recent experiments and simulations, 3,4 it has been demonstrated that certain metamaterial configurations exhibit scattering behav-ior consistent with the assumption of approximate frequency-dependent forms for ␧ and ␮. However, the techniques ap-plied in those studies probed the materials indirectly, and did not provide an explicit measurement that would assign val-ues for ␧ and ␮. In this Rapid Communication, we aim to show that the previous conjectures were indeed valid: unam-biguous values for ␧ and ␮ can be applied to electromagnetic metamaterials. Our approach here utilizes the transmission and reflection coefficients ͑S parameters, equivalently͒ calcu-lated for a wave normally incident on a finite slab of metamaterial. We invert the scattering data to determine re-fractive index n and impedance z, for systems of several thicknesses, from which we obtain self-consistent values for ␧ and ␮. While we utilize simulation data in this study, the technique we describe will be readily applicable to the ex-perimental characterization of metamaterial samples when-ever the scattering parameters are known. The common method of characterizing the electromag-netic scattering properties of a homogeneous material is to identify its z and n. 5,6 While it is possible to completely specify the scattering in terms of z and n, it is often more convenient to choose a second set of analytic variables that carry a direct material interpretation. These variables are the electric permittivity ␧ϭn/z, and the magnetic permeability ␮ϭnz. Both n and z, and therefore ␧ and ␮, are frequency-dependent complex functions that satisfy certain require-ments based on causality. For passive materials, Re(z) and Im(n) must be greater than zero.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence of new measurement approaches and applications for chiral thin films and materials enabled by the observations of the high sensitivity of second-order nonlinear optical measurements to chirality. In thin films, the chiral response to second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation (SFG) from a single molecular monolayer is often comparable with the achiral response. The chiral specificity also allows for symmetry-allowed SFG in isotropic chiral media, confirming predictions made approximately 50 years ago. With these experimental demonstrations in hand, an important challenge is the construction of intuitive predictive models that allow the measured chiral response to be meaningfully related back to molecular and macromolecular structure. This review defines and considers three distinct mechanisms for chiral effects in uniaxially oriented assemblies: orientational chirality, intrinsic chirality, and isotropic chirality. The role of each is discussed in experimental and computational studies of bacteriorhodopsin films, binaphthol, and collagen. Collectively, these three model systems support a remarkably simple framework for quantitatively recovering the measured chiral-specific activity.},

abstract = {We present a theory of second‐harmonic generation from chiral surfaces including contributions of electric and magnetic dipole transitions to the surface nonlinearity. The nonlinear polarization and magnetization of the surface as well as the second‐harmonic fields that are radiated in the reflected and transmitted directions are expressed in terms of the six possible bilinear combinations of the components of the electric field of the fundamental beam. For the case in which the polarization of the fundamental beam is controlled by means of a quarter‐wave plate between p‐polarized linear and left‐ and right‐hand circular, the second‐harmonic fields can be expanded in terms of only three different functions of the rotation angle of the wave plate. The process exhibits nonlinear optical activity, i.e., it responds differently to the two circular polarizations of the fundamental beam if the phases of certain expansion coefficients are different. The theory is used to explain the results of a recent experiment and excellent agreement is found. The results suggest that in the experiment the largest components of the susceptibility tensors that include magnetic contributions were of the order of ∼10{\%} of those of the electric dipole‐allowed susceptibility tensor.},

To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

abstract = {We present a design of dielectric metamaterials exhibiting a broad range of negative effective permeability in the terahertz spectral region. The investigated structures consist of an array of high-permittivity rods that exhibit a series of Mie resonances giving rise to the effective magnetic response. The spectral positions of resonances depend on the geometrical parameters of the rods and on their permittivity, which define the resonant confinement of the electromagnetic field within the rods. The electromagnetic coupling between the adjacent rods is negligible. With a suitable aspect ratio of the rods, a broadband magnetic response can be obtained.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate direct imaging and selective excitation of the bonding and antibonding plasmon mode in symmetric dipole nanoantennas using confocal two-photon photoluminescence mapping. Excitation of a high-quality-factor antibonding resonance manifests itself as a two-lobed pattern instead of the single spot observed for the broad bonding resonance in accordance with numerical simulations. The two-lobed pattern is observed due to the fact that excitation of the antibonding mode is forbidden for symmetric excitation at the feedgap, while concomitantly the mode energy splitting is large enough to suppress excitation of the bonding mode. The controlled excitation of modes in strongly coupled plasmonic nanostructures is mandatory for efficient sensors, in coherent control as well as for implementing well-defined functionalities in complex plasmonic devices.},

Such nanostructures can be used to enhance the chiroptical response of chiral molecules and could also significantly increase the enantiomeric excess of direct asymmetric synthesis and catalysis. Moreover, in optical metamaterials, chirality leads to negative refractive index and all the promising applications thereof. In this Progress Report, we highlight four different strategies which have been used to achieve giant chiroptical effects in chiral nanostructures. These strategies consecutively highlight the importance of chirality in the nanostructures (for linear and nonlinear chiroptical effects), in the experimental setup and in the light itself. Because, in the future, manipulating chirality will play an important role, we present two examples of chiral switches. Whereas in the first one, switching the chirality of incoming light causes a reversal of the handedness in the nanostructures, in the second one, switching the handedness of the nanostructures causes a reversal in the chirality of outgoing light.},

Previously FFPCs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short cavity lengths (≤ 200 $\mu$m). These characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long cavity lengths. By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser's transverse mode profile is eliminated. Consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with a high degree of rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence. Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs.},

Here, we review recent and ongoing progress in the realm of active, gain-enhanced nanoplasmonic metamaterials. On introducing and expounding the underlying theoretical concepts of the complex interaction between plasmons and gain media, we examine the experimental efforts in areas such as nanoplasmonic and metamaterial lasers.

A "chiral nihility" medium is explored in which both the permittivity and the permeability tend to zero. Some specific case studies of chiral nihility are presented, and Brewster angles are found to cover an extremely wide range. The E-field distributions in these different cases where the chiral slab is placed in free space are analyzed by using the appropriate constitutive relations.

abstract = {Second-harmonic generation can be used to probe chiral properties of surfaces and thin films with in-plane isotropy. We present a general formalism to analyse such chiral effects and apply it to review known effects and to introduce new effects. The formalism is based on expanding the fundamental and second-harmonic fields in terms of their p- and s-polarized components. Each second-harmonic signal can then be described in terms of only three nonlinear coefficients, which are associated with the quadratic combinations of the fundamental-field components . The coefficients can be classired as achiral (allowed for all isotropic surfaces) or chiral (allowed only for chiral surfaces) independent of the details of the nonlinear light-matter interaction. The basic signatures of chirality are intensity-difference effects in which the efficiencies of second-harmonic generation are different for left- and right- hand circularly-polarized light or two orthogonal linear polarizations, for example. These effects depend on proper phase relations between the achiral and chiral coefficients. Measurements in which the state of polarization of the fundamental beam is continuously varied by a rotating quarter-wave plate are shown to be sensitive to chirality independent of any particular phase relation between the coefficients. Such measurements can also be used to determine uniquely the relative complex values of the coefficients and thus to characterize completely the nonlinear chiral response . The ability of the techniques to distinguish absolutely between the enantiomers of a chiral sample is possible only if interference between the electric-dipole and higher-multipole parts of the coefficients dominates the chiral response.},

Traditionally, this method has been used to solve integral equations formulated for antennas and other components in the microwave frequency range and below. In this paper, the application of MOM in the field of plasmonics is briefly reviewed. First, existing literature is referenced. Then the differences with the classical implementations are pointed out. Finally, its applicability, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed. This is done by comparing it with a numerical finite difference time domain solver well-known in the plasmonics research community for a number of example structures. It is shown that also at these higher frequencies, namely in the IR and optical range, MOM is a very powerful technique. (Plasmonics::general)},

The results obtained agree with all existing experimental data obtained by various groups during the past few years. The possibility of separating out surface and bulk responses is considered using symmetry, polarization, or geometry arguments and it is concluded that for second-harmonic generation this cannot be done in general without additional information. Third-harmonic generation, barring any strong resonantly enhanced surface electric dipole effects, is essentially a bulk probe.},

abstract = {Recently, Tang and Cohen [Y. Tang and A. E. Cohen, Science 332, 333 (2011)] proposed and demonstrated the use of “superchiral” electromagnetic fields to enhance optical enantioselectivity. Their work generated much excitement as enantioselective signals are typically quite small, and it appeared that the enhancement factor could be extremely large. In this paper we explicitly show the limitations of such fields by including the magnetic susceptibility term. This term is small and is ignored in most cases compared to the electric polarizability term. However, for the fields used, the enhancement was obtained at the electric field energy node. Due to conservation of field energy, the magnetic field energy is then maximum, and the magnetic susceptibility contribution can no longer be ignored. This then is what limits the enhancement of the optical enantioselectivity. For a counterpropagating left- and right-circularly polarized light field, as used in the aforementioned experiment, we show that this fundamentally limits the enhancement to one or two orders of magnitude in general, determined by the ratio of the magnetic susceptibility to the electric polarizability of the material used. We also generalize the dissymmetry factor to include optical rotation effects present in chiral media, as opposed to fields being in vacuum. In the process, we generalize Lipkin's “Z000{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi {\_}moz-math-font-style="italic"{\textgreater}Z{\textless}mn{\textgreater}000 zilch” (or “optical chirality”) to that for a linear medium. This generalization shows that chirality of the material cannot be completely separated from chirality of the field and that opposite enantiomers are symmetric in terms of the dissymmetry factor enhancement. Finally, an analogy between ellipsometric chiroptical signal enhancement and enhanced optical enantioselectivity using a standing wave chiral field is discussed. Our analysis and generalization can be used as a guide for future searches of locally enhanced chiral fields.},

@article{Zhang2006,
abstract = {For the first time, all-dielectric planar chiral metamaterials consisting of arrays of silicon nitride gammadions on fused silica substrates have been fabricated, and shown to be capable of inducing large changes to the polarization states of transmitted light in a manner that is dependent on the two-dimensional chirality of the microstructured silicon nitride film. The polarization response is found to reverse for opposite enantiomers, and also for the same enantiomer when it is illuminated from opposite sides of the structure. In addition, the polarization states of the various diffracted beams are found to be non-reversible. These structures therefore appear to display elements of non-reciprocal behaviour. The polarization responses of complementary designs, different chiral geometries and various silicon nitride film thicknesses have also been studied. As a result we conclude that multiple reflections within the patterned silicon nitride layer play an important role in defining the mechanism by which these structures are able to modify the polarization states of diffracted light.},

The analysis is based on the assumptions that the system is driven at low intensity, and that the mechanical interaction is sufficiently weak, permitting a perturbative treatment. We find quantum interference in the scattering paths, which allows to suppress the Stokes-component of the scattered light.

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein ($\alpha$Syn), which forms amyloid fibrils, is linked to the neuronal pathology of Parkinson's disease, as it is the major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the inclusions that are characteristic of the disease. Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on $\alpha$Syn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the $\alpha$Syn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of $\alpha$Syn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.},

Whereas a is identical for the mirror-image forms or enantiomers of the molecule, b has opposite signs; the associated contribution to F therefore pointing in opposite directions. A simple optical field is presented for which vanishes but does not, so that F is absolutely discriminatory. We then present two potential applications: a Stern–Gerlach-type deflector capable of spatially separating the enantiomers of a chiral molecule and a diffraction grating to which chiral molecules alone are sensitive; the resulting diffraction patterns thus encoding information about their chiral geometry.},

abstract = {Based on a new, more complete form of macroscopic Maxwell equations, we discuss its influence on the studies of metamaterials, where coexisting electric and magnetic polarizations make unusual EM responses. The new scheme is derived by applying a long-wavelength approximation to the fundamental equations of microscopic non-local response theory, and it requires only one susceptibility tensor chicm (omega, k) to take care of all the electric and magnetic polarizations and their mutual interference in the different-order terms of the wave vector k. This scheme reduces to the conventional one in the absence of chiral symmetry, while the Drude-Born-Fedorov equations for the phenomenological description of a chiral medium turn out to be incorrect near the resonance frequency. In the conventional description of a non-chiral medium in terms of {\&}epsiv; and mu, it is required to use the magnetic susceptibility defined with respect, not to H, but to B with poles at magnetic transition energies.

We propose to use an optically levitated diamond bead containing a nitrogen-vacancy center spin. The nanoscale size of the bead makes the motional decoherence due to levitation negligible. The form of the spin-motion coupling ensures that the scheme works for thermal states so that moderate feedback cooling suffices. No separate control or observation of the c.m. state is required and thereby one dispenses with cavities, spatially resolved detection, and low-mass-dispersion ensembles. The controllable relative phase in the Ramsey interferometry stems from a gravitational potential difference so that it uniquely evidences coherence between states which involve the whole nanocrystal being in spatially distinct locations.},

abstract = {A medium that exhibits artificial magnetism can be formed by assembling an array of split ring resonators (SRRs)-planar conducting elements that exhibit a resonant response to electromagnetic radiation. The SRR exhibits a large magnetic dipole moment when excited by a magnetic field directed along its axis. However, the SRR also exhibits an electric response that can be quite large depending on the symmetry of the SRR and the orientation of the SRR with respect to the electric component of the field. So, while the SRR medium can be considered as having a predominantly magnetic response for certain orientations with respect to the incident wave, it is generally the case that the SRR exhibits magnetoelectric coupling, and hence a medium of SRRs arranged so as to break mirror symmetry about one of the axes will exhibit bianisotropy. We present here a method of directly calculating the magnetoelectric coupling terms using averages over the fields computed from full-wave finite-element based numerical simulations. We confirm the predicted bianisotropy of a fabricated SRR medium by measuring the cross polarization of a microwave beam transmitted through the sample. We also demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling that gives rise to the bianisotropic response is suppressed by symmetrizing the SRR composite structure and provide measurements comparing the cross polarization of the symmetric and asymmetric structures.

However, spectroscopic techniques have not been able to probe the structure of large biomolecules with similar levels of sensitivity. Here, we show that superchiral electromagnetic fields, generated by the optical excitation of plasmonic planar chiral metamaterials, are highly sensitive probes of chiral supramolecular structure. The differences in the effective refractive indices of chiral samples exposed to left- and right-handed superchiral fields are found to be up to 10(6) times greater than those observed in optical polarimetry measurements, thus allowing picogram quantities of adsorbed molecules to be characterized. The largest differences are observed for biomolecules that have chiral planar sheets, such as proteins with high $\beta$-sheet content, which suggests that this approach could form the basis for assaying technologies capable of detecting amyloid diseases and certain types of viruses.},

Specifically, we derive a Markovian master equation that treats the mechanical as well as optical degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Employing this equation, we solve for the nanoparticle phonon number dynamics exactly, and extract analytic expressions for the cooling timescale and the steady state phonon number. We present experimental data verifying the predictions of our model in the classical regime, and also demonstrate that quantum ground state preparation is within reach of ongoing experiments. Our work provides a quantitative framework for future theoretical modeling of the cavityless quantum optomechanics of optically trapped dielectric particles.},

Boundary conditions and energy conservation relations are derived. For the chiral layer, simple formulae are given for the reflection and transmission coefficients at normal incidence, in the weak chirality limit, near the critical angles, and for a thin layer. Analytic expressions are given for all the reflection and transmission amplitudes in the general case. An ellipsometric method of measuring the chirality of very small sample volumes is suggested.},

The substrate was transformed by Botrytis cinerea AM235, Absidia cylindrospora AM336, Absidia coerulea AM93, and Absidia glauca AM177 into more polar metabolites. The transformation of racemic piperitone ((±)-1) catalyzed by B. cinerea AM235 gave 7-hydroxypiperitone (2) as the only product. The biotransformation of (±)-1 by A. cylindrospora AM336 afforded mixture of three products: (-)-(R)-7-hydroxypiperitone ((-)-2), (+)-(4S,6R)-trans-6-hydroxypiperitone ((+)-3), and (+)-(4R,6R)-cis-6-hydroxypiperitone ((+)-4).

abstract = {Gold nanorods can be internalized by macrophages (an important early cellular marker in atherosclerosis and cancer) and used as an imaging contrast agent for macrophage targeting. Objective of this study is to compare two-photon luminescence (TPL) properties of four aspect ratios of gold nanorods with surface plasmon resonance at 700, 756, 844 and 1060 nm respectively. TPL from single nanorods and Rhodamine 6G particles was measured using a laser-scanning TPL microscope. Nanorod TPL emission spectrum was recorded by a spectrometer. Quadratic dependence of luminescence intensity on excitation power (confirming a TPL process) was observed below a threshold (e.g., {\textless}1.6 mW), followed by photobleaching at higher power levels. Dependence of nanorod TPL intensity on excitation wavelength indicated that the two-photon action cross section (TPACS) is plasmon-enhanced. Largest TPACS of a single nanorod (12271 GM) was substantially larger than a single Rhodamine 6G particle (25 GM) at 760 nm excitation. Characteristics of nanorod TPL emission spectrum can be explained by plasmon-enhanced interband transition of gold. Comparison results of TPL brightness, TPACS and emission spectrum of nanorods can guide selection of optimal contrast agent for selected imaging applications.},

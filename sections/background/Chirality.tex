The general mathematical form of a monochromatic plane wave at a distance $z$ and time $t$, oscillating at a frequency $\omega$, is given by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:generalwave}. The wave is polarised in the $x-y$ plane, and propagates along the $z$ axis with a wavevector $k_z$. $\phi$ describes the relative phase shift between the orthogonal components of polarisation, oscillating in the $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ directions with amplitudes $E_x$ and $E_y$ respectively.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:generalwave}
    \mathbf{E}= E_x  \mathbf{\hat{x}} \cos(k_z z-\omega t) - E_y \mathbf{\hat{y}} \cos(k_z z-\omega t +\phi)
\end{equation}
Linear combinations of $E_x$ and $E_y$, as in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:generalwave}, with no phase shift ($\phi=0$) result in linearly polarised light, with a polarisation axis depending on the relative amplitudes of $E_x$ and $E_y$. Crucially, linear combinations of $E_x$ and $E_y$ with non-zero amplitudes and a non-zero phase shift $\phi$ will result in a wave with angular momentum: The direction of polarisation rotates about the axis of propagation, tracing a helical profile. The ellipticity of this wave depends on both the phase and amplitude of the orthogonal linear components $E_x$ and $E_y$. Circular polarisation is the special case of a $\pm \pi/2$ phase shift between $E_x$ and $E_y$ of equal amplitude. The sign of the phase shift determines the direction of the polarisation rotation, resulting in left- and right-circularly polarised light (CPL). In this work, right-circularly polarised (RCP) light is defined as a clockwise rotation of the polarisation vector \textit{from the point of view of the wave source}. Conversely, left-circularly polarised (LCP) light is defined as a counter-clockwise rotation of the polarisation vector in the same frame. The wave equations for left- and right-circularly polarised light in this convention are given by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:CPL}~\cite[\S 8.1.2]{Hecht2013}). 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:CPL}
    \begin{split}
        & \mathbf{E}_{RCP} = E_0 \left[ \mathbf{\hat{x}} \cos(k_z z-\omega t) + \mathbf{\hat{y}} \sin(k_z z-\omega t )\right]\\
        & \mathbf{E}_{LCP}= E_0 \left[ \mathbf{\hat{x}} \cos(k_z z-\omega t) - \mathbf{\hat{y}} \sin(k_z z-\omega t )\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Since left- and right-circular polarisation states are orthogonal, any arbitrary polarisation can also be represented by the linear combination of LCP and RCP waves. For example, linear polarisation can be represented as the linear combination of equal amplitude LCP and RCP waves $\mathbf{E}_{LCP}$ and $\mathbf{E}_{RCP}$. 

Outside of the special case of CPL, the polarisation is described as elliptical, since both the total field amplitude, and the direction of polarisation, can vary as the wave propagates, resulting in an elliptical profile. The orientation of the elliptical profile, the ellipticity of the profile, and the direction of polarisation rotation, all depend on both the amplitudes of $E_x$ and $E_y$, and the phase between them.
Experimentally, elliptical and circular polarisations of light are realised by making use of an anisotropic, birefringent medium: One which has different refractive indices in orthogonal axes. Anisotropy in the real part of refractive index means that components of light polarised along the orthogonal axes, known as the medium's fast and slow axes, propagate with different phase velocities and accumulate a relative phase shift during propagation. By designing the thickness of the material such that the accumulated phase shift is $2m\pi \pm \pi/2$ at the operating wavelength $\lambda$ (where $m$ is some integer), elliptically and circularly polarised light can be obtained. Such a device is known as a quarter-wave plate (QWP), as it induces a shift of $\lambda/4$ between orthogonal polarisation components. The orientation of the elliptical profile depends on the direction of the incident polarisation, and the ellipticity depends on the angle of the material's fast axis relative to the direction of incident polarisation (figure~\ref{fig:QWP_in_out}). Similarly, the orientation of linear polarisation can be rotated (known as ``optical rotation'', OR) by making use of a half-wave plate (HWP), which induces a relative phase shift of $2m\pi \pm \pi$ between orthogonal polarisation components. The angle of optical rotation also depends on the angle of the material's fast axis relative to the direction of incident polarisation.

\end{figure}

Whereas linear birefringence results from structural anisotropy, a medium with structural \textit{chirality}, such as a chiral molecular system, can exhibit a similar dissymmetry in it's interaction with LCP and RCP light. This leads to chiral-optical (chiroptical) effects, directly beneficial for polarisation optics, however also used to optically probe unknown properties of chiral structures. The rest of this chapter discusses the physical origin of chiroptical effects relevant to this work, and the parameters used to characterise the interactions between chiral structures and light.


\section{Structural Chirality}\label{sec:background:Chirality:Structural}
In the simple case of a linear, isotropic medium with no magnetoelectric coupling, the macroscopic electromagnetic response of the material is described by the constitutive relations given in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:isotropicConstitutive}. These relate the material's internal electric displacement field $\bf{\tilde D}$ and magnetic field strength $\bf{\tilde D}$ to the driving electric and magnetic fields $\bf{\tilde E}$ and $\bf{\tilde B}$. Here, $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are complex (denoted by a tilde) scalars and correspond to the isotropic electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the material.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:isotropicConstitutive}
	\begin{split}
        & \bf{\tilde D} = \tilde \varepsilon \bf{\tilde E} \\
        & \bf{\tilde B} = \tilde \mu \bf{\tilde H}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
In the general case however, we cannot assume isotropy and a lack of magnetoelectric coupling. For a bi-anisotropic medium, the constitutive relations take the form of equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:fullConstitutive}.\cite{Ishimaru2003, Capolino2009}. Here, $\bf{\tilde \varepsilon}$, $\bf{\tilde \mu}$, $\bf{\tilde \xi}$, and $\bf{\tilde \zeta}$ are $3 \times 3$ matrices due to the anisotropy of the material. $\bf{\tilde \xi}$, and $\bf{\tilde \zeta}$ describe the magneto-electric cross-coupling.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:fullConstitutive}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bf{\tilde D} \\
        \bf{\tilde B}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bf{\tilde \varepsilon} & \bf{\tilde \xi} \\
        \bf{\tilde \zeta} & \bf{\tilde \mu}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bf{\tilde E} \\
        \bf{\tilde H}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In the case of a non-gyrotropic material (exhibiting no magneto-optic rotation), equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:fullConstitutive} has additional constraints, due to time-reversal symmetry, given in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:nongyroConstraints} \cite{Ishimaru2003}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:nongyroConstraints}
    \begin{split}
        &[\bf{\tilde \xi}]^t = -[\bf{\tilde \zeta}] \\
        &[\bf{\tilde \varepsilon}]^t = [\bf{\tilde \varepsilon}] \\
        &[\bf{\tilde \mu}]^t = [\bf{\tilde \mu}]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
The expressions shown in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:isotropicConstitutive} are a special case of equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:fullConstitutive}, where no magneto-electric cross-coupling is present, so $\bf{\tilde \xi}=\bf{\tilde \zeta}=0$ and due to isotropy, $\bf{\tilde \varepsilon}$ and $\bf{\tilde \mu}$ become scalars. 
In the case of a non-chiral anisotropic material, $\bf{\tilde \xi}=\bf{\tilde \zeta}=0$ however $\bf{\tilde \varepsilon}$ and $\bf{\tilde \mu}$ remain as matrices. Most relevant in this discussion however is the special case of a bi-isotropic, or isotropic chiral, medium. 
In this case the matrix components reduce to scalars, but all four components remain. The constraints given in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:nongyroConstraints} apply, and so we find that $\xi =-\zeta $.

There are several ways to write the remaining relations, including Post's relations~\cite{Capolino2009}, Born's relations~\cite{Lekner1999, Barnett2016} , and Tellegen's relations~\cite{Capolino2009,kong1986,lindell1994} (equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:tellegensRelations}). Tellegen's relations will be used here, however the various forms are equivalent.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:tellegensRelations}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{D} \\
        \mathbf{B}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r & i \kappa \sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0} \\
        -i \kappa \sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0} & \mu_0 \mu_r
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{E} \\
        \mathbf{H}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Here, ${{\varepsilon }_{r}}$ and $\mu_r$ are the relative permittivity and permeability of the material respectively, and $\kappa$ is known as the ``chirality parameter''. Solving Maxwell's equations for a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the $z$ direction through the medium described by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:tellegensRelations} results in two eigenwaves with wave numbers given by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:kpmKappa}~\cite{Wang2014a, Qiu2008}, where $k_0$ is the wave number in vacuum. In a chiral medium these eigenwaves of wave number ${{k}_{+}}$ and ${{k}_{-}}$ correspond to right and left circularly polarized light respectively.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:kpmKappa}
    {k_\pm } = {k_0}\left( {\sqrt {{\mu _r}{\varepsilon _r}}  \pm \kappa } \right)
\end{equation}
From this, the corresponding refractive indices for RCP and LCP light are given by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:npmKappa}~\cite{Capolino2009, Qiu2008, Valev2013b}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:npmKappa}
    {n_ \pm } = \sqrt {{\mu _r}{\varepsilon _r}}  \pm \kappa
\end{equation}

\section{Chiroptical Effects}\label{sec:background:Chirality:Chiroptics}
Any material with a non-zero chirality parameter $\kappa$ will necessarily exhibit chiroptical effects dependent on it's real and imaginary parts. As in section~\ref{sec:background:Chirality:Structural}, the real part of the refractive index of a medium $n$ describes the phase velocity of light propagating through the medium, and the imaginary part describes the absorption of light by the medium. From equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:kpmKappa}, $\operatorname{Im}(\kappa)$ thus describes the differential \textit{absorption} of LCP and RCP light, known as circular dichroism (CD). In linear optics, the circular dichroism at a particular wavelength of light is defined by equation~\ref{eq:background:Chirality:CD}. Here, $E_{RCP}$ and $E_{RCP}$ are the amplitudes of RCP and LCP light \textit{after} interaction with the chiral material. If $\operatorname{Im}(\kappa) = 0$, light can still be absorbed by the medium, but due to mirror symmetry, RCP and LCP light will emerge with equal amplitudes, and the CD as defined in equation~\ref{eq:background:Chirality:CD} is zero. For a non-zero $\operatorname{Im}(\kappa)$, $E_{RCP}$ and $E_{RCP}$ depend on both the magnitude of $\operatorname{Im}(\kappa)$, and the propagation length through the absorbing medium. If the propagation length is known, then circular dichroism can be used as a probe for the chirality parameter $\kappa$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:Chirality:CD}
    \textrm{CD}= \arctan\left( \frac{E_{RCP} - E_{LCP}}{E_{RCP} + E_{LCP}} \right)
\end{equation} 
Correspondingly, $\operatorname{Re}(\kappa)$ describes the differential \textit{phase velocity} for LCP and RCP light. Since linearly polarised light can be represented by a superposition of equal-amplitude LCP and RCP waves, a linearly polarised wave, of vacuum wavevector $k_z$ propagating through a medium with RCP and LCP refractive indices given by $n_+$ and $n_-$ respectively, is described by equation~\ref{eq:background:Chirality:OR}~\cite[\S 8.10]{Hecht2013}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:Chirality:OR}
    \begin{split}
        \mathbf{E} = E_0 \cos(k_z (\frac{n_+ + n_-}{2})z -\omega t &) \left[ \mathbf{\hat{x}} \cos(k_z (\frac{n_+ - n_-}{2})z ) \right. \\
        & \left. + \mathbf{\hat{y}} \sin(k_z (\frac{n_+ - n_-}{2}) z)\right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
At any point in time throughout propagation, the RCP and LCP components are oscillating in phase and with equal amplitudes, meaning that the resultant wave remains linearly polarised. However, the orientation of the linear polarisation will rotate throughout propagation, with the rate and direction of rotation depending on the magnitude and sign of $n_+ - n_-$ respectively. This effect is the chiral counterpart to birefringence, where orthogonal \textit{linear} polarisations exhibit different phase velocities. It is thus known as ``circular birefringence''. In the case of linear birefringence, optical rotation is achieved by utilising a fixed $\lambda/2$ phase shift, and rotating the mediums fast axis relative to the incident polarisation to control the angle of rotation. Conversely, a material exhibiting circular birefringence will rotate linearly polarised light continuously during propagation. Therefore, the resulting angle of optical rotation depends on both the strength of circular birefringence, and the propagation length through the medium. Optical rotation can therefore also be used as a method to characterise the chirality parameter $\kappa$ of the material.

Generally, in real materials the refractive index $n$ is strongly wavelength-dependent. This includes contributions from the structural chirality parameter, better given as $\kappa(\lambda)$. This directly leads to wavelength-dependent CD and OR, the latter specifically known as optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). CD spectra can be measured by taking extinction spectra LCP and RCP light propagating through the material, and applying equation~\ref{eq:background:Chirality:CD} at each wavelength, where $E_{RCP}$ and $E_{RCP}$ are the amplitudes of the transmitted RCP and LCP light respectively. Similarly, ORD spectra can be obtained by propagating linearly polarised light through the medium, and detecting the intensity of transmitted light through a rotatable analysing polariser. The analyser angle transmitting maximum intensity gives the resulting angle of polarisation, which can be compared to the incident polarisation to find the angle of optical rotation. Again, this can be taken at each wavelength to construct an ORD spectrum. It is important to reiterate however, that OR and CD depend on the real and imaginary parts of the same complex refractive index $n$. CD and ORD spectra are thus intrinsically linked by the Kramers-Kronig transforms: each can be obtained from the other, and they fundamentally contain the same information.

\section{Optical Chirality and ``Superchiral'' Light}\label{sec:background:Chirality:opticalchirality}
The interaction between a chiral molecule and a chiral electromagnetic field is expected to exhibit a dissymmetry, in that each ``handedness'' of a chiral field should interact differently with a chiral molecule or nanostructure. A field with a shorter chiral pitch in the local EM field will exhibit a stronger interaction dissymmetry than a less twisted field. It had long been thought that the maximum possible chiral dissymmetry is obtained for a perfectly circularly polarized monochromatic field, however in 2010 Tang and Cohen proposed a setup in which the dissymmetry exceeds that of CPL (referred to as ``superchiral light'') at the nodes of a chiral standing wave.~\cite{Tang2010}
The strength of the field chirality can be quantified by Lipkin's 00-zilch density~\cite{Lipkin1964} referred to by Tang and Cohen as the ``optical chirality'' $C$ as given in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:opticalchirality}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:opticalchirality}
    \begin{split}
        C = &\frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2}{\bf{\tilde E}} \cdot (\nabla  \times {\bf{\tilde E}}) + \frac{1}{{2\mu _0}}{\bf{\tilde B}} \cdot (\nabla  \times {\bf{\tilde B}}) \\
        = &- \frac{{{\varepsilon _0}\omega }}{2} \operatorname{Im}[ \bf{\tilde E}(\bf{r}) \cdot \bf{\tilde B}(\bf{r}) ]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $\bf{\tilde E}$ and $\bf{\tilde B}$ denote the complex electric and magnetic field amplitudes respectively. This quantity describes the angular momentum of the curl of the optical field~\cite{Cameron2012a} and is a conserved property of the field. Tang and Cohen showed that the enantioselectivity of optical excitation of a molecule is highly dependent on $C$, and so it stands that such a superchiral field can lead to significant enhancement of the enantioselective excitation of chiral molecules.

The general response of a chiral molecule to a monochromatic electromagnetic field is described by an internal electric dipole moment $\mathbf{\tilde p}$ and magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{\tilde m}$ as in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:tangDipole}.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:background:chirality:tangDipole}
    \begin{split}
        &{\bf{\tilde p}} = {{\tilde \alpha }_{ee}}{\bf{\tilde E}} - i{{\tilde \alpha }_{em}}{\bf{\tilde B}} \\
        &{\bf{\tilde m}} = i{{\tilde \alpha }_{em}}{\bf{\tilde E}} + {{\tilde \alpha }_{mm}}{\bf{\tilde B}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $\tilde{\alpha}_{ee}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{mm}$ correspond to $\tilde{\alpha}$ and $\tilde{\chi}$ in references~\cite{Tang2010} and~\cite{Choi2012}, 
$\alpha_{ee}$ is the electric polarisability, and $\alpha_{mm}$ is the magnetic susceptibility. $\tilde{\alpha}_{em}$ is the mixed magneto-electric polarisability and is directly related to the material chirality parameter $\kappa$ (section~\ref{sec:background:Chirality:Structural}).
Physical quantities are obtained from the real parts of equation (14). For an incident $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}=\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{0}{e}^{-i\omega t}$ and $\mathbf{\tilde{B}}=\mathbf{\tilde{B}}_{0}{e}^{-i\omega t}$ the rate of excitation of a molecule from right ($+$) and left ($-$) CPL is given by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:Aplusminus} \cite{Tang2010, Choi2012}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:Aplusminus}
    {A^ \pm } = 
    \frac{\omega }{2}{\left\langle {{\bf{E}} \cdot {\bf{\dot p}} + {\bf{B}} \cdot {\bf{\dot m}}} \right\rangle _t} = 
    \frac{\omega }{2}{\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} ({{\bf{\tilde E}}^ * } \cdot {\bf{\tilde p}} + {{\bf{\tilde B}}^ * } \cdot {\bf{\tilde m}})
\end{equation}
Substituting equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:tangDipole} into equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:Aplusminus} leads to equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusFull}, which can be rewritten in terms of the generalized optical chirality $C$ to give equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusC}~\cite{Choi2012}. Here ${\tilde \alpha }_{em}''=\operatorname{Im}({\tilde \alpha }_{em})$.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusFull}
    {A^ \pm } = \frac{\omega }{2}({\tilde \alpha ''_{ee}}{\left| {{\bf{\tilde E}}} \right|^2} + {\tilde \alpha ''_{mm}}{\left| {{\bf{\tilde B}}} \right|^2}) \pm {\tilde \alpha }_{em}''\omega {\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} ({{\bf{\tilde E}}^ * } \cdot {\bf{\tilde B}})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusC}
    {A^ \pm } \simeq \frac{\omega }{2}({\tilde \alpha ''_{ee}}{\left| {{\bf{\tilde E}}} \right|^2} + {\tilde \alpha ''_{mm}}{\left| {{\bf{\tilde B}}} \right|^2}) \pm {\tilde \alpha }_{em}''\frac{2}{\varepsilon }C
\end{equation}
The time averaged electric and magnetic energy densities ${{\left\langle {{U}_{E}} \right\rangle }_{t}}=\tfrac{\varepsilon }{4}{{\left| {\mathbf{\tilde{E}}} \right|}^{2}}$ and ${{\left\langle {{U}_{B}} \right\rangle }_{t}}=\tfrac{1}{4\mu }{{\left| {\mathbf{\tilde{B}}} \right|}^{2}}$  can be introduced here, and substituted into equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusC} to give the rate of excitation in terms of energy density as in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusU}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:AplusminusU}
    \begin{split}
        & {A^ \pm } \simeq \frac{2}{\varepsilon }{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{ee}}\omega \left( {{{\left\langle {{U_E}} \right\rangle }_t} + \gamma {{\left\langle {{U_B}} \right\rangle }_t}} \right) \pm {\tilde \alpha }_{em}''\frac{2}{\varepsilon }C \\
        & \gamma  = \frac{{{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{mm}}}}{{{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{ee}}}}\varepsilon \mu  = \frac{{{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{mm}}}}{{{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{ee}}}}\frac{{{n^2}}}{{{c^2}}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
We can now define the dissymmetry factor $g$ of the chiroptical interaction by equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryA}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryA}
    g = \frac{{{A^ + } - {A^ - }}}{\frac{1}{2}({A^ + } + {A^ - })}
\end{equation}
In Tang and Cohen's proposal~\cite{Tang2010} the magnetic field was disregarded as negligible. Under this assumption, the dissymmetry factor is found to be 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryG}
    g =  - \frac{{{\tilde \alpha }_{em}''}}{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{ee}}\frac{{2C}}{{\omega {{\left\langle {{U_E}} \right\rangle }_t}}}
\end{equation}
Note that under this approximation, the dissymmetry factor splits into properties of the molecule only (${{\tilde \alpha }_{em}''}/{{\alpha }''}_{ee}$) and properties of the field only (${2C}/{\omega {{\left\langle {{U}_{E}} \right\rangle }_{t}}}$), however in the general case the dissymmetry factor cannot be separated in this way and is significantly more complex~\cite{Choi2012}.
The full expression accounting for magnetic energy density can be simplified by assuming a small dissymmetry factor such that $n_{LCP} \approx n_{RCP}$, to give equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryFull}.~\cite{Choi2012}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryFull}
    g =  - \frac{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{em}}{{{\tilde \alpha ''}_{ee}}}\frac{{2C}}{{\omega [{{\left\langle {{U_E}} \right\rangle }_t} + \gamma {{\left\langle {{U_B}} \right\rangle }_t}]}}
\end{equation}
The limitation in chiroptical enhancement is now clear: at regions of low electric energy density, the magnetic energy density is maximized and should not be considered negligible. The $\gamma$ term in equation~\ref{eq:background:chirality:dissymmetryFull} is then the key limiting factor for the dissymmetry enhancement. The energy density terms in the denominator can no longer be reduced to arbitrarily small values in order to continually increase chiral dissymmetry. However, the chiral dissymmetry can still be increased by reducing the total electromagnetic energy density, increasing the structural chirality parameter of the medium, and increasing optical chirality $C$ of the electromagnetic field.

    \item Chemicals have been used to understand chirality (ref section)
    \item However, nanomaterials can be better (ref section)
    \item Mention that bits of the background sections are lifted from my parts of the review paper
    \item Briefly introduce some work not discussed in the thesis

Time has also been spent developing Python libraries to simplify data acquisition and analysis on a range of experimental setups within the group. While not discussed in this thesis, diffraction CID experiments undertaken by C. Kuppe (reference~\cite{Kuppe2018}) made use of an experiment-automation library I developed during this project, and eventually merged into a larger library, detailed in appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:labdo}. Data analysis shown in section~\ref{sec:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices} made use of another Python library I developed to automate the filtering, processing, and plotting of data from our SHG optical activity setup. The library, detailed in appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:pyshg}, has since been used in submitted work by D. C. Hooper, and is expected to be used in similar experiments going forward.

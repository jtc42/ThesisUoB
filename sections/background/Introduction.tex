\chapter{Motivation and Structure}\label{sec:background:Introduction}
\color{red}
This chapter might be unnecessary, as the motivation is kind of discussed in the Chirality chapter. A brief overview of the chapter structure might be nice though?
Mention that bits of the background sections are lifted from my parts of the review paper! Maybe mention microscopy work with Dave Carbery somehow?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding chirality is important
    \item Chemicals have been used to understand chirality
    \item However, nanomaterials can be better (ref section)
\end{itemize}

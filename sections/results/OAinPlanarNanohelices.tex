This section has largely been copied verbatum from the manuscript \textit{``Second Harmonic Generation Optical Rotation Solely Attributable to Chirality in Plasmonic Metasurfaces''}, Joel~T.~Collins et. al. \cite{Collins2018b}. 
Experiments were planned by V. K. Valev. Samples were prepared by N. V. S. Braz and P. A. Warburton. Experiments were executed by V. K. Valev, E. Slenders and M. Ameloot. Near-field and scattering simulations were performed by X. Zheng and G. A. E. Vandenbosch. Numerical simulations of the far-field, linear CD were performed by S. Zu and Z. Fang. 
Analysis of the nonlinear microscopy data was performed by myself, with Python code including sections written by V. K. Valev. The formulation and analysis of modal circular-dichroism based on the near-field simulations was also performed by myself. I produced the first draft of the manuscript, and all authors have subsiquently contributed.

Chiral plasmonic nanostructures, those lacking mirror symmetry, can be designed to manipulate the polarization of incident light resulting in chiroptical (chiral optical) effects such as circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotation (OR). Due to high symmetry sensitivity, corresponding effects in second harmonic generation (SHG-CD and SHG-OR) are typically much stronger in comparison. These nonlinear effects have long been used for chiral molecular analysis and characterization, however both linear and nonlinear optical rotation can occur even in achiral structures, if the structure is birefringent due to anisotropy. Crucially, chiroptical effects resulting from anisotropy typically exhibit a strong dependence on structural orientation. Here we report large second-harmonic generation optical rotation of $\pm\SI{45}{\degree}$, due to intrinsic chirality in a highly anisotropic helical metamaterial. The SHG intensity is found to strongly relate to the structural anisotropy, however the angle of SHG-OR is invariant under sample rotation. We show that by tuning the geometry of anisotropic nanostructures, the interaction between anisotropy, chirality, and experiment geometry can allow even greater control over the chiroptical properties of plasmonic metamaterials.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:introduction}
Modern nanofabrication techniques have allowed the development of optical “metamaterials”, whose properties are determined not only by the choice of materials, but also by their geometry. The strong dependence on geometry enables the design of metamaterials exhibiting tailored optical properties.\cite{Pendry2004a, Alu2007, Kauranen2012, Meinzer2014, Moitra2015, Cong2015, Prudencio2016}. 
Optical metamaterials, consisting of sub-wavelength metallic nanostructures, can greatly benefit from surface plasmon resonances. The latter result from collective excitations of free electrons, at the frequency of incident light. The enhanced local electromagnetic fields can be shaped with a sense of twist, quantified by the parameter: optical chirality.\cite{Tang2010, Schaferling2012}
Recently, chirality, the absence of mirror symmetry, has drawn interest to plasmonic metamaterials due to applications in photonic devices,\cite{Rizza2015, Esposito2016, Hou2016} nanorobotics,\cite{Urban2015, Schamel2013a}, and in particular chemical sensing.
Chiral metamaterials exhibit enhanced chiroptical (chiral-optical) effects\cite{Schaferling2014, Karimullah2015, Canaguier-Durand2014} that in turn are used to characterize chiral molecules, crucial for organic- and bio-chemistry.\cite{Zhao2017, Hendry2010, Tullius2015}
Two widely used chiroptical effects are circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotation (OR), which are due to a difference in absorption and phase velocity of left- and right- circularly polarized light, respectively. Previously, large plasmon-enhanced CD and OR effects have been reported in chiral metamaterials.\cite{Papakostas2003, Kuwata-Gonokami2005a, Decker2007, Plum2007, Gansel2011}
Because CD and OR originate from the real and imaginary part of the refractive index, respectively, the two effects are linked by the Kramers-Kronig transforms.\cite{Barron2004, Parson2007, Govorov2011}
However, this link is not necessary for nonlinear chiroptical effects; since nonlinear CD and OR do not result from the real and imaginary parts of a single complex number. 

For second harmonic generation (SHG), the two nonlinear chiroptical effects SHG-CD and SHG-OR are often seen as much more sensitive~\cite{Petralli-Mallow1993} counterparts to CD and OR. However, they are also fundamentally different from, and can be highly complementary to, the linear chiroptical effects. For the latter, interacting parallel components of electric and magnetic dipoles are strictly necessary. This necessity is lifted in the nonlinear case. Since SHG is a three-wave mixing process, chiroptical effects can arise from the 3D chiral arrangement of electric dipoles only.\cite{verbiest2009second} 
SHG chiroptical effects can also originate from the interaction between electric and magnetic dipoles, as well as between electric dipoles and quadrupoles. This specificity allows SHG to discriminate between the two principal models of chirality:\cite{Fischer2005a} Kuhn's ``chirally-coupled dipoles''~\cite{Kuhn1930} and Kauzmann's ``one electron on a helix''~\cite{Kauzmann1957a} models. More precisely, the two can be separated by measuring SHG-OR. 

Whereas SHG-CD has been demonstrated from numerous chiral nano/meta-materials,\cite{Hooper2017, Mamonov2017, Chen2016, Kolkowski2015, Belardini2014} far less attention has been devoted to SHG-OR. Previous studies have demonstrated SHG-OR in plasmonic nanostructures, where the origin of the effect can be ambiguous.\cite{Romain2017, Ren2012a, Mamonov2012} Indeed, SHG-OR can be due to both intrinsic structural chirality and sample anisotropy. An unambiguously chiral origin of SHG-OR has not been reported in nano/meta-materials. 

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:results}
Here, we demonstrate clear SHG-OR in plasmonic metamaterials, which is due to intrinsic chirality; the SHG-OR angle does not depend on the sample rotation angle and it reverses upon mirroring the geometry. Conversely, for the same sample, the linear OR angle depends strongly on the rotation of the sample, which demonstrates a dominant contribution from anisotropy rather than chirality, in the linear case. Moreover, we show that SHG-OR can also be dominantly sensitive to the anisotropy of the samples, depending on the experimental geometry and on the particular values of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor components involved. 

The samples used in our experiments are arrays of hexagonally-arranged Au:Cu (80:20) nanohelices,\cite{Gibbs2014} shown both schematically and in a cross-sectional SEM image, in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:setup}a and Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:setup}(b) respectively. 
For the sake of conciseness, only one handedness of the structures is shown, however both left- and right-handed nanohelices were investigated. The individual nanohelices have a pitch of $\SI{37}{\nano\m}$, and height of $\SI{81}{\nano\m}$, a wire thickness of $\SI{18}{\nano\m}$, and the nanohelices have an inner and outer diameter of $\SI{28}{\nano\m}$ and $\SI{55}{\nano\m}$, respectively. Consequently, the structures are substantially sub-wavelength ($\approx\lambda/10$, at 800 nm).
Our experimental setup (shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:setup}c, with details in Section~\ref{sec:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:methods}) is designed to precisely measure the polarization of SHG emission from the samples. By varying both the sample azimuthal rotation angle and the analyzing polarizer angle, a heatmap is produced. The latter shows the intensity of SHG emission, as a function of both sample rotation (along the $y$-axis) and analyzer rotation (along the $x$-axis).

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}a shows SHG hotspots corresponding to the polarization of SHG emission as the sample is rotated. The green markers on Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}a show the angle of SHG polarization for each sample rotation angle. Relative to the incoming S-polarized light (perpendicular to the plane of incidence), an SHG-OR of approximately $+\SI{45}{\degree}$ is observed for the left-handed structures. \textit{This SHG-OR angle does not change significantly over the regions of SHG emission, i.e. over hundreds of degrees of sample rotation.} 
Moreover, upon measuring the right-handed structures, the SHG-OR reverses to approximately $-\SI{45}{\degree}$. This behavior is exactly as expected for SHG-OR due to intrinsic chirality. The intensity of SHG emission does vary upon rotation, suggesting a dipole coupling between the incident light and the end terminations of the nanohelices.

    \textbf{a)} SHG optical rotation heatmaps for both enantiomorphs of helical metamaterial. S-polarized incident light results in rotated linearly polarized SHG emission. By continuously rotating the analyzer, the angle of maximum intensity at each sample rotation can be obtained (shown in green markers). For the left-handed structure an SHG-OR angle of around $+\SI{45}{\degree}$ is found. In the mirrored, right-handed structure, the SHG-OR changes sign, to around $-\SI{45}{\degree}$. Importantly, in both cases the angle remains relatively unchanged upon sample rotation, though the overall intensity varies periodically. \textbf{b)} SHG optical rotation heatmap for both enantiomorphs of the helical metamaterial, for P-polarized incident light. In this case, both the angle of SHG-OR and the intensity of SHG emission are strongly dependent on sample rotation. Additionally, there is no clear reversal between enantiomorphs of the metamaterial. Instead, the sign of SHG-OR reverses under sample rotation, suggesting contributions from anisotropy dominating over contributions from the structure’s intrinsic chirality.}	
\end{figure}

Importantly, SHG-OR is not always independent of sample anisotropy. As discussed in section~\ref{sec:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:discussion}, SHG is a highly symmetry-sensitive technique, whereby symmetry is expressed in the values of nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements. Depending on the experimental geometry, and on the values of these tensor elements, competing symmetries within the structure can be dominant in the measured results. Indeed, we demonstrate this in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}b. The data presented in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}b were obtained from the same nanohelices, however whereas in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}a we used S-polarized light, here P-polarized light was employed. As in Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}a, the heat maps correspond to SHG intensity as a function of sample and analyzer rotation angles. Contrary to Figure~\ref{fig:results:OAinPlanarNanohelices:combined_data}a, the SHG-OR angle changes significantly over the regions of SHG emission, closely following the sample rotation angle. This behavior is exactly as expected for SHG-OR, dominantly due to sample anisotropy. The experimental geometry must be carefully selected to address the structural chirality exclusively.

The nonlinear chiroptical behavior reported here is in stark contrast to the linear chiroptical case. The linear OR of the nanohelices was investigated with optical microscopy and spectroscopy. White light from a halogen lamp is linearly polarized and directed to the sample through an Axio Imager M2 microscope.

By rotating the analyzer slightly away from crossed ($\SI{90}{\degree}$), the spectral dependence of optical rotation can be observed. Longer wavelengths are transmitted more through the analyzer when oriented at $+\SI{5}{\degree}$ away from crossed. Crucially, upon rotating the structure by $\SI{90}{\degree}$, the OR appears to reverse: longer wavelengths are now transmitted more through the analyzer when oriented at $-\SI{5}{\degree}$ from crossed. \textbf{b)} Linear OR map obtained from a spectrometer connected to the microscope viewport, showing clear dependence on sample rotation. Since the sample is between crossed polarizers, positive and negative OR both increase the measured intensity.}
